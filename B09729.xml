            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THere are two very great and moſt dangerous Rocks in the Sea of this World, which ought to be moſt carefully and heed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided and eſcaped by us, that we may at last ſafely arrive at that bleſſed Haven of Reſt; I mean, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and eternal Happineſs: That is to ſay, <hi>Deſperation</hi> on the one hand, and <hi>Preſumption</hi> on the other: On one of which the moſt of the Sons of Men, even in the Profeſſed Church alſo, do ſplit their ſouls; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by drown themſelves in endleſs and
<pb facs="tcp:185024:3"/>
everlaſting miſery and ſorrows. And oft-times when they are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the evil, and would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſecure themſelves from the danger of the one, they fall foul upon, and make ſhipwrack of their ſouls upon the other. Somewhat like unto our <hi>Types</hi> in former times, who by liſtening unto the evil Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the many diſcouraging <hi>Spies,</hi> were firſt greatly diſcouraged, and even <hi>Deſpaired</hi> of ever getting to <hi>Canaan: And all the Congregation lifted up their Voice, and cried; and the people wept that night. And all the Children of</hi> Iſrael <hi>murmu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red againſt</hi> Moſes, <hi>and againſt</hi> Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron: <hi>And the whole Congregation ſaid unto them, would God that we had died in the Land of</hi> Egypt; <hi>or would God we had died in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Numb.</hi> 13. 28-33. and <hi>ch.</hi> 14. 1-4. But when they were convinced of that provoking Iniquity of theirs, and confeſſed
<pb facs="tcp:185024:3"/>
they had ſinned by their unbelief; Then, as is related in the ſame Chapter, they fell into the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream of <hi>Preſumption:</hi> And before the time, and againſt <hi>the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the LORD, they preſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to go up unto the hill:</hi> By means whereof, <hi>their enemies ſmote and diſcomfited them;</hi> Numb. 14. 40-45. Deut. 1. 27-32. with ver. 41-44. <hi>Now all theſe things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened unto them for Types,</hi> or En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſamples, <hi>and they are written for our Admonition, upon whom the ends of the World are come;</hi> 1 Cor. 10. 10-12. To the end <hi>we ſhould not fall,</hi> or miſcarry, <hi>after the ſame Example of Unbelief and Diſobedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence;</hi> as, Heb. 4. 11.</p>
            <p>And as the Scriptures are excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently uſeful and powerful in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to deliver us from erring in mind or way, on the right hand, or on the left; <hi>and to make us wiſe to ſalvation, through faith in Chriſt</hi>

               <hi>Jeſus;</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 20, 21. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 15, 16. So is this Scripture in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular (which is the ſubject of the following Treatiſe; in which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained the moſt Solemn <hi>Oath of the Lord God;)</hi> an excellent <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Pilot,</hi> to diſcover unto us, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver our ſouls from the danger and peril of the two fore-mentioned Rocks: And to cauſe us to ſail moſt ſafely and ſecurely in the middle way: and at laſt to bring us into <hi>the Boſome, or Bay of Abraham</hi> (as Luke 16. 22. with Act. 27. 39.) For,</p>

               <hi>I.</hi> The former part of it is a moſt powerful Antidote againſt the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal and maligne Diſeaſe of <hi>Deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration;</hi> In that <hi>the Lord God ſwears by his life, that he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely conſidered: <hi>Is not this Balm of</hi> Gilead, <hi>and this</hi> ſupreme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly excellent <hi>Phyſician there,</hi> moſt vertuous and powerful to heal this
<pb facs="tcp:185024:4"/>
deadly Diſtemper? <hi>Why then is not the health of the Daughter of God's people recovered?</hi> (as Jer. 8. 21, 22.) If any ſay, There are many able, conſciencious, and experienced Doctors, who maintain, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly contend for, ſuch Opinions as are inconſiſtent herewith, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite hereto: As to ſay, <hi>That the greateſt part of Mankind was Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, or paſt by, before they were Born: And that God hath therefore ſome ſecret Pleaſure in their Deſtruction: That Chriſt did not taſte death, by the Grace of God, for every Man; but for the feweſt of Mankind, for the Elect only:</hi> As they ſpeak. <hi>That God doth not give that Grace to all, whereby they may be ſaved;</hi> &amp;c. To this, and all the reſt of this nature that can be ſaid, I may give anſwer, and ſay as <hi>Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hu</hi> did to <hi>Job; God,</hi> the Almighty God, <hi>is greater than Man,</hi> then ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſinful Man, <hi>Job</hi> 33. 12. <hi>And,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:185024:5"/>
               <hi>ſhall any teach God knowledge, ſeeing he judgeth thoſe that are high?</hi> Job 21. 22. And beſides, where are thoſe Doctors, who plead for theſe ſtrange and ſpurious Noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that dare ſwear, as the Lord God here doth, and ſay; <hi>As the Lord liveth, theſe Doctrines are true and ſound; and the Lord God hath pleaſure in the Death of the greateſt part of the wicked?</hi> Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, how daring and adventurous ſoever they are in aſſerting or plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for their divers and ſtrange Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines, there are none, that I have heard of, that are ſo confident of the verity of them, as moſt ſolemnly to ſwear, They are the undoubted Truths of God. Or if any ſhould ſo be, whether is it meet in the ſight of God to hearken unto them, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord God of Truth, judge ye? for without controverſie, <hi>the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God is greater than the wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of</hi> any <hi>man,</hi> or men whatſoever; 1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 9, 10, 11.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="tcp:185024:5"/>
And indeed, it is a matter of great and weighty moment and concernment unto men, to know, and heartily believe, <hi>the kindneſs and love of God our Saviour to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> and to the greateſt ſinners thereof, whileſt it is called to day; and how unwilling he is with their Deſtruction; To the end they may be preſerved, or delivered from <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperation:</hi> And that both,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe there is in men, at ſometimes however, or in ſome caſes, to wit, when their ſins are ſet in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der before them, and judgments are feared, or felt by them; a too great propenſity and readineſs to fall thereinto: As is ſtrongly intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to us herein: In that when the Lord charges the Prophet to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint his people, That <hi>at what inſtant he ſhould ſpeak concerning a Nation, or concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to deſtroy: If that Nation againſt</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:185024:6"/>
               <hi>whom he hath pronounced, turn from their evil, he will repent of the evil that he thought to do unto them.—Now therefore,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>Go to, ſpeak to the men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſaying, Thus ſaith the LORD, behold I frame evil, and deviſe a device againſt you: Return ye now every one from his way, and make your ways and your doings good. And they ſaid, There is no hope,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 18. 5. 12. Here was nothing propounded to cauſe them to make ſuch an evil conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but that which might ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally have preſerved them there-from: yet we ſee how preſently they cry out, their caſe was hopeleſs. But how much ſooner will men do ſo, when evil Teachers inſinuate into them in their corrupt and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging Doctrines, That God hath no cordial deſire, or delight, in the ſalvation of the moſt of men, but a
<pb facs="tcp:185024:6"/>
ſecret pleaſure in their endleſs ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and calamity! And alſo,</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is highly behoofful for men to be delivered from <hi>Deſperation;</hi> becauſe when they fall thereinto, they thereby are prepared to become <hi>deſperately wicked</hi> (as, Jer. 17. 9.) and to ruſh themſelves into any, or all iniquity and wickedneſs, as the horſe ruſheth into the battle; to wit, without fear or conſideration: As they ſaid, <hi>There is no hope, but we will walk after our own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, and we will every one do the imagination, obſtinacy, or ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs of his evil heart;</hi> Jer. 18. 12. So again, <hi>Thou ſaidſt, there is no hope, no, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go;</hi> Jer. 2. 25. When men heartily en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain deſpairing thoughts, and confidently believe there is no mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy for them, they then caſt off the fear of God, and all care thereto relating; and commit all abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb facs="tcp:185024:7"/>
with greedineſs; as believing they of neceſſity muſt and can but pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh in concluſion. O that therefore, thoſe that are Teachers of others, would take heed and beware of all ſuch pernicious Doctrines as tend to ingulph the ſouls of men in the Bottomleſs Pit. Again,</p>

aid and divine aſſistance: that ſo none may abuſe the goodneſs of God, and ſay, <hi>We ſhall have peace, though we walk in the ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination of our hearts, to adde Drunkenneſs to Thirſt,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 29. 18-24. with Heb. 12. 15, 16-29. And the Lord, who is a God of knowledge, hath ſeen it needful, uſually to aſſure men of his hatred of ſin: and of the neceſſity of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and turning there-from unto him, when he is proclaiming his mercy and grace towards ſinners, and his unwillingneſs with their perdition; as is largely ſhewn in the following Diſcourſe. To the end that none might preſume of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying life, perſisting in their ſins and abominations. And he doth oftentimes give his people warning, <hi>not to hearken to thoſe Prophets who daubed them up with untem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pered mortar, and ſpake ſmooth things, and propheſied deceits un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:185024:8"/>
               <hi>them;</hi> telling them, <hi>that they ſpake a Viſion of their own heart, not out of the mouth of the Lord;</hi> Jer. 14. 13-16. and ch. 23. 9-16-18. Ezek. 13, &amp;c. And the holy Spirit, by the Apoſtle <hi>Peter,</hi> hath expreſly ſpoken, <hi>that as there were falſe Prophets among the People</hi> (of the Jews) <hi>ſo there would be falſe Teachers amongſt us</hi> (Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans) <hi>who would privily bring in hereſies of deſtruction, denying the Lord that bought them, and bring upon themſelves ſwift deſtruction. And many would follow their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ways,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. Matth. 7. 13-15.</p>
            <p>To the end then that none of us may be preſumptuous, take we heed and beware of ſuch Doctrines as theſe are, to wit, <hi>That all that Chriſt died for, ſhall be eternally ſaved. That all that belong to the Election of Grace</hi> (as they ſpeak) <hi>ſhall, when God's time comes, be</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:185024:8"/>
               <hi>converted by an irreſiſtable power, will they, nill they. That once in Chriſt, and ever in Chriſt. That all that live and die in Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with ſuch or ſuch a Viſible Church, ſhall partake of eternal life in concluſion;</hi> with other ſtrange Doctrines of a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plection: For they directly tend to lead men into <hi>Preſumption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And becauſe men are very incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable to flatter themſelves in their evil ways, until their Iniquity be found to be hateful; and are very apt to preſume that God will be merciful to them, though they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge themſelves in their evil courſes: needful therefore it is, that thoſe that have the lip of knowledge, ſhould ſo uſe it, <hi>as to ſpeak the things which become ſound Doctrine;</hi> as Tit. 2. 1, 11-15. <hi>And,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, preach the Word, be inſtant in ſeaſon, out of ſeaſon, reprove,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:185024:9"/>
               <hi>rebuke, exhort; with all long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and Doctrine:</hi> 2 Tim. 4. 1, 2-4. <hi>that ſo they may be pure from the blood of all men;</hi> as Act. 20. 21-26, 27.</p>
            <p>I ſhall add no more at this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but refer thee to the inſuing <hi>Treatiſe,</hi> deſiring it may be ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conſidered by thee; and the Scriptures therein quoted ſearched into: And that we may all of us <hi>prove all things, and hold faſt what is good; and abſtain from every kind of Evil.</hi>

            <p n="1">1. The Occaſion of theſe Words, or of this <hi>Charge</hi> given to the Prophet: And that is laid down and declared before, in the fore-going part of this Chapter; where, firſt, By way of Parable; and then more plainly and openly the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaints the Prophet, <hi>That he had ſet him a Watchman to the Houſe of Iſrael:</hi> And what his Work and Office was; with the great Danger to himſelf upon his neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting, or being unfaithful in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="2 letters">

When I ſay to the wicked, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely die: If thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity: but his blood will I require at thine hand. Nevertheleſs, if thou warn the wicked from his way, to turn from it; if he do not turn from his way, he ſhall die in his iniquity: but thou haſt delivered thy Soul.</hi>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:185024:10"/>
Verſe 1-7-9. Like that alſo, Chap. 3. 17, 18. whereto is added, <hi>Therefore, O thou Son of Man, ſpeak unto the Houſe of Iſrael; thus ye ſpeak, ſaying, If our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions and our ſins be upon us,</hi> (namely, in the guilt and puniſhment of them; as <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 30, 31. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. 20. <hi>(If there be no forgiveneſs of them, or deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from them;) and we pine away in them, how then ſhould we live?</hi> (How ſhould we be juſtified from them, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy Gods Favour, or be made Parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers of Eternal Life?)</p>
            <p>In which words, eſpecially as compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with <hi>Verſe</hi> 11. is ſignified to us; That there are in men, eſpecially when God is reproving, threatning, and judging them, evil and hard thoughts of God, as if he had ſome ſecret Will or Pleaſure in their eternal ruine and deſtruction: <hi>The heart</hi> (of Man) <hi>is deceitful above all things, and deſperately wicked;</hi> Jer. 17. 9. <hi>From within, out of the heart of men, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed evil thoughts, wickedneſs, blaſphemies,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Matth.</hi> 15. 19, 20. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 20-23. They are then ready to conclude againſt themſelves, <hi>that their caſe is deſperate, and that there is no hope for them:</hi> Jer. 2. 25. and 18. 11, 12. They are then ready
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:185024:11"/>
to ſay with <hi>Cain, Our iniquities are greater than can be forgiven:</hi> Gen. 4. 13. That God hath no love toward them: Or, that there is no forgiveneſs with him that he may be feared, and returned to by them: <hi>that he hath no hands:</hi> That he hath ſo tied up himſelf by his Decree, that he cannot help, ſave, deliver, or redeem them from that miſerable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition they have brought themſelves in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 9. and 50. 1-4. This is the fruit and product of Sin, that it makes Sinners afraid of God, and even deſpair of his Mercy and Goodneſs. Thus it was with our firſt Father <hi>Adam,</hi> when he had ſinned, and eaten of the Tree whereof God had commanded him he ſhould not eat; he then ſaid unto God when he called him, <hi>I heard thy Voice in the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and was afraid becauſe I was naked, and I hid my ſelf;</hi> Gen. 3. 8-11. Yea through infirmity, good men by liſtning to their own hearts, have queſtioned Gods love toward them, when they have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the afflicting hand of God. Thus it was with <hi>Aſaph, Will the Lord cast off for ever?</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and will he be favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able no more? Is his mercy clean gone for ever? Doth his promiſe fail for evermore?</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:185024:11"/>
               <hi>Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger ſhut up his tender mercies? And I ſaid, this is mine Infirmity,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 77. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 13, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Needful therefore it is for us <hi>to hate thoughts,</hi> our own evil and naughty thoughts, <hi>and to love Gods Law and Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine:</hi> ſo <hi>ſhall we have great peace, and nothing ſhall offend us:</hi> Pſal. 119. 113. with Verſe 165. <hi>To waſh our hearts from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, that we may be ſaved;</hi> and not to ſuffer <hi>vain thoughts to lodge within us: for Gods thoughts are not our thoughts, nor our ways his ways: But as the Heavens are higher than the Earth, ſo are his ways higher than our ways; and his thoughts than our thoughts:</hi> Jer. 4. 14. with Iſa. 55. ver. 9. <hi>He that trusteth in his own heart is a fool:</hi> Prov. 28. 26.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Seeing alſo when God is denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Judgments againſt, or executing Judgments upon evil Doers, they are ready to deſpond, and to conclude, God delights in their Ruine and Miſery: Therefore it appears that they do a very bad work, and are very injurious to the Souls of Men, who ſtrengthen them in ſuch evil and deſpairing thoughts: as they do, who ſay, <hi>The moſt of men were</hi>
               <pb n="6" facs="tcp:185024:12"/>
               <hi>reprobated before they were born; And that there is no poſſibility of their eſcaping the vengeance of Eternal Fire.</hi> Theſe diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage the hearts of men, and hinder them from returning unto God from their Iniquity, (as <hi>Num.</hi> 13. 32. with <hi>Deut.</hi> 1. 28.) Truly men need not be ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the evil Doctrines of others, in ſuch hard Conceptions and wicked Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginations of God: <hi>for their thoughts are an abomination to the LORD:</hi> Prov. 15. 26. When God intimates, That the end of his framing Evil, and deviſing a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice againſt them, was, not their Ruine and Deſtruction, but, <hi>that they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn every one from his evil way, and make their ways and doings good.</hi> Yet then they ſaid, <hi>There is no hope, but we will walk after our own devices,</hi> &amp;c. Jer. 18. 7, 8. 11, 12. How much rather would they ſo conclude, when they are ſtrengthned in their evil Imaginations of God, by ſuch Doctrines as are too too rife among us, in which men inſinuate, that there is no hope for the greateſt part of Mankind: 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 1. But we ſhall here add no more unto the Occaſion of theſe Words we have propounded to ſpeak unto. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. We have the Words themſelves to

mind and conſider: In which we may take notice in general, How the Lord, by this Prophet, doth Anſwer them; and, contrary to their wrong and evil thoughts and ſayings, gives a gracious Diſcovery of himſelf unto them<hi>:</hi> And therein he doth not ſimply ſpeak good and gracious words to them; But in and by them makes known the Graciouſneſs of his Heart unto them, And that he hath no pleaſure in their Deſtruction, but that they turn from their wicked ways and doings; Jer. 18. 1-11. When <hi>none can ſtand before his indignation, none is able to abide in the fierceneſs of his wrath; his fury is poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him. Yet the LORD is good, a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble, and he kneweth them that truſt in him:</hi> Nah. 1. 2-7. Joel 2. 1-11-13. Rev. 3. 16-19, 20.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall deſire to look a little par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly into the Words themſelves<hi>:</hi> wherein we hvae to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſon that ſaith theſe Words, and chargeth the Prophet to acquaint <hi>Iſrael</hi> herewith<hi>: [ſaith the LORD GOD.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="8" facs="tcp:185024:13"/>
2. The <hi>Confirmation</hi> of what he ſaith by an Oath, <hi>[As I live.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. The Subject Matter thus ſpoken and confirmed by this moſt excellent Perſon<hi>:</hi> And that is laid down and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded,</p>
            <p n="1">1. Negatively, <hi>[I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Affirmatively and Poſitively: <hi>[But that the wicked turn from his way and live.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The Perſon that ſaith theſe words, and who Commands and Charges the Prophet to Acquaint <hi>Iſrael</hi> herewith; And that is, <hi>The Lord, [Say, ſaith the LORD GOD.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now as theſe Words contain in them a Charge given to the Prophet thus to ſpeak; ſo it ſhews unto us, That the Holy Prophets in former times, ſpake not, nor came in their own Name, or with their own Words; but in the Lords Name, and with his Words<hi>:</hi> He doth not Command the Prophets to ſay, <hi>Thus ſaith</hi> Iſaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel: No, but <hi>thus ſaith the Lord God of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Prophets:</hi> Rev. 22. 6. <hi>The Prophets have ſpoken to us in the Name of the Lord:</hi> Jam. 5. 10. <hi>And they have ſpoken to us the Word of God:</hi> Hebr. 13. 7. <hi>Theſe holy</hi>
               <pb n="9" facs="tcp:185024:13"/>
               <hi>men ſpake not by the will of man, but they ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> 2 Pet. 1. 20, 21. And ſo the holy Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles have delivered to us that which alſo they received of the Lord<hi>:</hi> And that, <hi>not in the words which mans wiſdom teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, bu which the Holy Ghoſt taught:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 1-3. with Chap. 11. 23. and Ch. 2. 12, 13. And the things which they wrote unto us, <hi>they are the Commandments of the Lord:</hi> 1 Cor. 14. 36, 37. Thus the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>John</hi> was commanded to write to the Seven Churches in <hi>Aſia; Theſe things ſaith,</hi> not <hi>John,</hi> but, <hi>the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> in thoſe ſeveral Deſcriptions he there gives of himſelf; as may be ſeen in <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 1, 8, 12, 18. and Ch. 3. 1, 7, 14. And as the Conſideration of the Infinite Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of the Perſon that thus chargeth the Prophet to ſay, might encourage him againſt all his Diſcouragements to ſpeak what he was Commanded by him to ſpeak, and to walk in the ſtrength of the <hi>LORD GOD;</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 71. 16. As it is ſaid, <hi>The LORD GOD hath ſpoken, who can but Prophecy?</hi> Amos. 3. 7, 8. So alſo it is powerful to engage us, to give moſt earneſt heed unto, and to believe the Words of the holy Prophets and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles,
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:185024:14"/>
becauſe they are the Words of the Lord God: And to receive them, <hi>not as the words of man, but as they are in truth, the word of God.</hi> And in ſo doing, <hi>they will work effectually in us:</hi> 1 Theſ. 2. 13. Ezek. 6. 3. Mica 6. 1.</p>
            <p>But we may ſpeak a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly to the Perſon that Commands and Charges the Prophet thus to ſay in his Name and Words, unto the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. It is the <hi>LORD GOD</hi> that ſpeaks ſo graciouſly concerning ſinful and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ones: to wit, He who is the <hi>Creatour</hi> and <hi>Former</hi> of all things; <hi>And who hath made all Nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth; and hath determined before the times appointed, and the bounds of their habitations, that they ſhould ſeek him:</hi> Gen. 2. 4, 7, 18, 21, 22. with Acts 17. 26, 28. He who made all things at the firſt, <hi>and made all things very good: And who made man in his own Image, after his own likeneſs.</hi> And who intended not our deſtruction and ruine, but our good and welfare<hi>:</hi> He it is who thus ſpeaks to ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and unworthy Ones: <hi>He hath a deſire to the Works of his own hands:</hi> Job. 14. 15. Pſal. 138. 8. <hi>It is he that hath made us, and</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:185024:14"/>
               <hi>not we our ſelves:—Enter into his Gates with thanksgiving, and into his Courts with praiſe; be thankful unto him, and bleſs his Name. For the LORD is good, his mercy is everlasting,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 100. Rev. 4. 11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is the <hi>LORD GOD,</hi> who when we had ſinned againſt him, and treache<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly departed from him, and were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come enemies to him, yet did not turn an enemy to us; but was ſtill merciful and gracious towards vain ſinful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, even to Admiration; as the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> intimates, ſaying, <hi>LORD! what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him? the Son of man, that thou makeſt account of him? Man is like to vanity:</hi> Pſal. 144. 3, 4. and and 8. 4-6. with Heb. 2. 6-9. And who, in the greateſt of his love and pity, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed from the beginning, <hi>That the Seed of the Woman ſhould break the Head of the Serpent:</hi> Gen. 3. 14, 15. And therein, and thereby vertually, <hi>the LORD GOD laid for a foundation</hi> (of Faith and Hope for Mankind) <hi>a Stone, an elect, precious Corner-ſtone, a ſure Foundation:</hi> Iſa. 28. 16. and 50. 2-5. He is the Lord, he chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth not, therefore we are not conſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med<hi>: Matth.</hi> 3. 6. with <hi>Lam.</hi> 3. 22. And who in the fulneſs of the time, performed
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:185024:15"/>
that Promiſe which he formerly made, in raiſing up a Saviour, <hi>the Saviour of the world.</hi> This is he that Commands his Prophet thus to ſpeak unto the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> To which we may ſpeak more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It is One who is <hi>abundant in truth,</hi> that charges his Prophet to ſpeak theſe gracious words; <hi>He is a God of truth, and without iniquity, juſt and right is he:</hi> Exod. 34. 6. Deut. 32. 4. <hi>He is the Lord God of truth:</hi> Pſal. 31. 5. Whoſe mouth ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth truth, and wickedneſs is the abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of his Lips<hi>:</hi> All the words of his mouth are in righteouſneſs, there is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing froward or perverſe in them; as <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 4-6-8. <hi>Who hath written to us excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent things in counſels and knowledge; that he might make us know the certainty of the words of truth,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 22, 20-21. We ought therefore to bow down our Ears, and hear the Words of this moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent One; and firmly, and with all our hearts to believe them<hi>: Prov.</hi> 22. 17-20. For he is not a man that he ſhould lye<hi>: God forbid; yea, let God be true, but every man a lyar: As it is written, That thou mayeſt be juſtified in thy ſayings,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 3. 3-5.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="13" facs="tcp:185024:15"/>
4. It is the holy <hi>LORD GOD,</hi> who gives this Command to his Prophet<hi>:</hi> As they ſay, <hi>Who is able to ſtand before this holy Lord God?</hi> 1 Sam. 6. 20. <hi>He is not a God that hath pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him: The fooliſh ſhall not ſtand in his ſight: He hateth</hi> (as with a reſpect to a love of delight) <hi>all the workers of iniquity:</hi> Pſal. 5. 4-6. He is one that is a perfect hater of Sin; One that loveth righteouſneſs, and hateth iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; as <hi>Heb.</hi> 1. 8, 9. One who is Holineſs it ſelf<hi>:</hi> And though he be <hi>merciful and gracious, and abundant in goodneſs,—yet he will by no means clear the guilty:</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. <hi>Art thou not from everlaſting, O Lord my God, mine holy One?</hi> Saith the Prophet<hi>:—Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity,</hi> &amp;c. Hab. 1. 12, 13. Sin is the abominable thing which he hates: <hi>Jer.</hi> 44. 4. And therefore whatever he here ſpeaks, or charges his Prophet to ſay in his Name concerning his Graciouſneſs towards Sinners, he ſpeaks not at all in favour to their ſins, or to encourage them to go on and continue therein; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards may be ſhewn more largely; but in love and pity to the Souls of poor Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:185024:16"/>
that they might turn from their Iniquity, that it might not be their Ruine.</p>
            <p>This is the Perſon who commandeth his Prophet thus to ſay unto the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. We have nextly to conſider, the aſſured Confirmation he gives of the truth of what he ſaith, and which he aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and confirms by his Oath, <hi>[(As) I live:]</hi> For theſe words are an Oath, and ſo oft uſed; as the Lord ſaith elſewhere<hi>: But as truly [as I live] they ſhall not ſee the Land which I ſware unto their Fathers,</hi> &amp;c. And again, <hi>Say unto them, as truly [as I live] ſaith the LORD, as ye have ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in mine ears, ſo will I do unto you,</hi> &amp;c.

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:185024:16"/>
places; ſo here we are to underſtand it: The Lord God aſſures us of the truth of his ſaying, and confirms it by his Oath: <hi>Say unto them [I live] ſaith the LORD GOD. . . .</hi> Now in this Oath let us dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gently mind,</p>

            </list>
            <p n="1">1. The Oath it ſelf, <hi>[I live] ſaith the LORD GOD.</hi> He here ſwears to the truth of what he ſaith, <hi>By his life,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>By himſelf:</hi> For ſo this Oath is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated to us<hi>:</hi> Hence whereas it is ſaid in one place <hi>[I live] ſaith the Lord;</hi> It is in another thus rendred; <hi>I have ſworn by [my ſelf:]</hi> Compare <hi>Rom.</hi> 14. 11. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 45. 23. So here we may underſtand it, <hi>becauſe he could not ſwear by a Greater, he ſware by Himſelf, by his Life:</hi> Heb. 6. 13. As he hath Life in and of himſelf, and lives for ever. And here, that which he ſwears by, is without Controverſie, or confeſſedly true; and unqueſtionable with all but groſs Atheiſts: <hi>For he is the living God, and an everlaſting King:</hi> Jer. 10. 10. Indeed ſometimes he ſwears by that which he doth, or may abhor; as it is ſaid in one place, <hi>The LORD hath ſworn by the excellency of</hi> Jacob. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:185024:17"/>
in another place it is ſaid; <hi>Thus ſaith the LORD, the God of Hoſts, I abhor the excellency of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and hate his Palaces,</hi> &amp;c. Compare <hi>Amos</hi> 8. 7. with Chap. 6. 8. <hi>Nah.</hi> 2. 2. And when he ſo ſwears, it might be queſtion'd by ſome, whether he, in ſuch an Oath, ſwears as he thinks; becauſe he ſwears by that which he ſaith, he abhors and hates. Sometimes he ſwears by his <hi>right hand:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>The LORD hath ſworn by his right hand, and by the arm of his ſtrength:</hi> Iſa. 62. 8. But <hi>that</hi> may not ſometimes, or in ſome Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, be exerted, but ceaſe from acting, as it were: As the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> intimates, ſaying, <hi>Why with-draweſt thou thine hand, even thy Right hand? pluck it out of thy Boſom:</hi> Pſal. 74. 11. And ſo his Arm, the Arm of his Strength, may be ſometimes, as it were, aſleep, and feeble there-through<hi>:</hi> As it is intimated, when it is ſaid; <hi>Awake, awake, put on ſtrength, O Arm of the LORD, awake as in the ancient days in the generations of old,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 51. 9. And when he ſwears by this Oath, it might be ſuppoſed what he ſwears to, is not duly regarded, while his Right hand is in his Boſom, and the Arm of his Strength aſleep, and laid to reſt. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:185024:17"/>
he ſwears by his <hi>Name:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>Behold, I have ſworn by my Great Name, ſaith the LORD:</hi> Jer. 44. 26. But of <hi>that</hi> many are too too ignorant<hi>: Who hath known his Name, or his Sons Name?</hi> Prov. 30. 4. Pſalm 9. 10. And therefore when he ſo ſwears, many might be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſay, Alas, why ſhould we ſet our hearts hereto, or give credit unto what he ſwears by his <hi>Name?</hi> for we do not know what his <hi>Name</hi> is, or what it means. Sometimes he ſwears by his <hi>Holineſs:</hi> As it is written, <hi>The LORD GOD hath ſworn by his Holineſs,</hi> &amp;c, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos 4. 2. But ſuch may be his Providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as that ſometimes his holy Ones have been put to a ſtand, how to recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cile his Providential Government with his Holineſs<hi>:</hi> (Though yet, without all peradventure, he is infinitely Holy; yea Holineſs it ſelf: Compare <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 2. with Chap. 6. 8.) Thus the Prophet intimates, in his expoſtulation with God, ſaying, <hi>Art not thou from everlaſting, O Lord, my God, mine holy One?—Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity. Wherefore lookest thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wicked devoureth the man that is more righteous than he: And</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:185024:18"/>
               <hi>makeſt men as the fiſhes of the Sea, as the creeping things that have no Ruler over them?</hi> &amp;c. Hab. 1. 12, 13, 14-17. and Ch. 2. 1-4. Thus alſo the <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> relates Gods Oath in this manner; <hi>Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs, if I lye unto</hi> David<hi>: his Seed ſhall endure for ever, and his Throne as the Sun before me.—But thou haſt caſt off, and abhorred: thou haſt been wroth with thine Anointed. Thou haſt made void the Covenant of thy Servant: thou haſt propha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned his Crown, by caſting it to the ground,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 89. 34-39, &amp;c. But now here he ſwears by a moſt unqueſtionable, and undubitable Oath; he ſwears <hi>by himſelf, by his life,</hi> which is from everlaſting to everlaſting<hi>:</hi> As 'tis ſaid, <hi>The Angel lifted up his hand to Heaven, and ſware by him that liveth for ever and ever, who created Heaven, and the things that therein are;</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 10. 5, 6. he ſwears by his <hi>Being, by his Eternal Power and Godhead, which he hath manifeſted unto all men by the Works of his Creation and Providence:</hi> as Rom. 1. 20. Let this be ſeriouſly conſidered by us.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mind we alſo, the Reaſon and End of his Oath; and that is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. On his Part<hi>:</hi> For the Confirmation of the Truth of what he ſaith, and ſwears
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:185024:18"/>
to: and ſo it is called by the Apoſtle, <hi>An Oath of Confirmation:</hi> Heb. 6. 16. to aſcertain the Truth of what is ſo aſſured and confirmed. So alſo the Covenant which God made with <hi>Abraham,</hi> to wit, That in his Seed all the Families of the earth ſhould be bleſſed: And at the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king whereof, he ſware by himſelf, is ſaid, to be <hi>confirmed of God in Chriſt:</hi> Gal. 3. 15-17. and Act. 3. 25. with Gen. 22. 16-18. As alſo, God is ſaid to ſwear <hi>by himſelf,</hi> to evidence unto others <hi>the unchangeable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his purpoſe:</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>God willing to ſhew more abundantly—the immutability of his Counſel, interpoſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by an Oath;</hi> which is alſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly called, <hi>An immutable thing:</hi> Heb. 6. 17, 18. So here we may ſay, <hi>The LORD ſware, and will not repent:</hi> as, Pſ. 110. 4. <hi>He hath</hi> herein <hi>ſworn in truth, and will not turn from it:</hi> as, Pſal. 132. 11. To aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure us of the Immutability of his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel, he therefore ſware <hi>by his life:</hi> And we may therefore know and be confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that his Thoughts and Pleaſure are the ſame toward wicked Ones now, as then they were<hi>: For he is</hi> Jehovah, <hi>he changeth not: with him is no variableneſs, nor ſhadow of turning:</hi> Mat. 3. 6. Jam. 1. 17.
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:185024:19"/>
               <hi>He is the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever:</hi> Heb. 13. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Lord God alſo ſwears <hi>by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> for the Confirmation of his Word, and to ſhew the Immutability of his Counſel, on our part; or as with reſpect to us; becauſe we are ſo ſlow to believe him on his Word: As he ſaith concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his people in former times, <hi>How long will it be ere they believe me?</hi> Num. 14. 11. So it may be extended more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally; we are too ready and apt to doubt of, or be unbelieving concerning what he ſpeaks unto us; and therefore, becauſe of our backwardneſs and unapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to believe, he confirms his Saying with his Oath. Our Saviour ſaith to his Diſciples, <hi>Let your yea be yea, and your nay, nay; for whatſoever is more than theſe, cometh of evil:</hi> or, <hi>is from,</hi> or, <hi>out of evil.</hi> Not that he hereby condemns all ſwear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but inſtructs his Diſciples, that Oaths, though in ſome Caſes uſeful and needful, are yet <hi>out of evil:</hi> And ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other things, mens unbelief, or doubting of the truth of what is affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a bare Word, occaſions an Oath for the Confirmation of it. So, warily underſtanding it, we may ſay, as with
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:185024:19"/>
reſpect to Gods ſwearing; it is at ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>out of,</hi> or, <hi>from evil:</hi> Matth. 5. 37. And ſo here particularly; The Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> being convinced of their evil, and Judgment being threatned againſt them therefore, <hi>thus they ſpake,</hi> ſaying, <hi>If our tranſgreſſions and our ſins be upon us, and we pine away in them, how then ſhould we live?</hi> Ezek. 33. 10. They were ready to deſpond and deſpair of Gods mercy to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: Now then God thus ſwears unto them, becauſe of their ſlowneſs of heart, to believe him on his Word. Thus alſo it is ſaid, <hi>An Oath of Confirmation is an end of all ſtrife, gain-ſaying, or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction:</hi> Heb. 6. 16. So here, God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of their readineſs to contradict and gain-ſay, in their hearts at leaſt, ſwears <hi>by himſelf:</hi> As alſo to the end they might not gain-ſay any more, but firmly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the truth of that ſo Affirmed and Confirmed, he interpoſeth himſelf by an Oath, <hi>Exod.</hi> 17. 15, 16. And that he might lift up their hands which hang'd down, and they might have <hi>ſtrong Conſolation,</hi> in returning to him from their evil and wicked ways. And as God interpoſed himſelf by an Oath to <hi>Abraham,</hi> to the end, that the Heirs of his Promiſe might,
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:185024:20"/>
by this Immutable thing alſo, aſſuredly know and believe the truth of that ſo confirmed; and <hi>might have ſtrong con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation;</hi> Heb. 6. 16-18. So here alſo, <hi>God hath ſworn by himſelf, that he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of the wicked:</hi> That men might give glory to him in believing, and have ſolid Conſolation in this great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement ſet before them; to the truth whereof he hath as it were <hi>bound himſelf,</hi> or, <hi>his ſoul,</hi> with the Bond of this moſt Indubitable Oath: as <hi>(Num.</hi> 30. 2-4. <hi>Acts</hi> 23. 12-14.)</p>
            <p n="3">3. We have in the next place to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, and ſpeak unto, <hi>the ſubject-matter</hi> thus Affirmed and Confirmed, by this moſt excellent Perſon: And by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable Oath: And that is laid down and propounded to us,</p>
            <p>1. Negatively, <hi>[I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.]</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now hereto we may ſpeak in this Order; to wit,</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. By way of Explication, or explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the words.</item>

            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:185024:20"/>
1. By way of Explication, let us en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire into, and conſider theſe things:</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. What <hi>[Death]</hi> is that here ſpoken of and intended?</item>
               <item>2. Who are <hi>[the wicked]</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture account?</item>
               <item>3. What are we to underſtand by this Phraſe, <hi>[no pleaſure?]</hi>
               </item>
               <item>4. What time is that in which he hath no Pleaſure? <hi>[I have.]</hi>
               </item>
            </list>
            <p n="1">1. What is <hi>[the Death]</hi> here ſpoken of and intended, when he ſaith, <hi>I have no Pleaſure in [the Death] of the wicked,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Now in Anſwer thereto, we may ſay, The Scripture ſpeaks onely of <hi>two Deaths</hi> in General; As, <hi>the Wages of Sin:</hi> In one of which all leſſer Deaths are contained and comprehended<hi>:</hi> namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is that <hi>Death</hi> which is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately called, <hi>the firſt Death;</hi> which was threatned unto the Firſt Man, <hi>Adam,</hi> Male and Female, in caſe they ſhould eat of the forbidden Fruit<hi>:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>Of the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it; for in the day that thou eateſt thereof, in dying thou ſhalt die:</hi> Gen. 2. 17. And under the Sentence whereof, <hi>Adam</hi> and all his Poſterity fell; upon his eating of that Tree, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:185024:21"/>
God commanded him he ſhould not eat<hi>:</hi> As the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>By one man ſin entred into the world, and death by ſin, and ſo death paſſed upon all men; for that,</hi> or, <hi>in whom, all have ſinned:</hi> Rom. 5. 12. <hi>By Man,</hi> (even by the firſt publick man, <hi>came Death; for in</hi> Adam <hi>all die:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 21, 22. And this Firſt Death had been an Eternal Death, had not our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, by the Grace of God, taſted it for every man, and overcome and aboliſhed it: 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 9, 10. And he will in due time deſtroy it: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 26. It is a ſtrange, unreaſonable, and dangerous miſtake of ſome, who ſay, that <hi>Chriſt died not for this firſt Oflence, or the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary Branches thereof: or that he taſted not this firſt Death for men:</hi> For if ſo, how then came he to be promiſed of God, before he paſſed the Sentence upon our Firſt Parents? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3. 15-19. Or how ſhall men be Raiſed out of this Firſt Death, but by him who was delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification? <hi>By Man came the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the Dead: for as in</hi> Adam <hi>all die, even ſo in Chriſt ſhall all be made alive.</hi> To wit, Quickned and Raiſed out of the Firſt Death: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 21, 22. <hi>God hath</hi>
               <pb n="25" facs="tcp:185024:21"/>
               <hi>given Chriſt authority to execute judgment:</hi> And by his Voice to Bring forth all Men out of their Graves, <hi>Becauſe he is the Son of Man:</hi> John 5. 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is another and worſe <hi>Death,</hi> which is ſeveral times called expreſly, <hi>The ſecond Death:</hi> To wit, as with reſpect to Men; into which ſuch will be caſt for their own perſonal tranſgreſſions, after they are raiſed out of the <hi>firſt Death,</hi> and judged by Chriſt; who remained in their Impenitency, Unbelief, and Diſobedience, till the Day of Grace and Patience was ended, and died therein: <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 16. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 8, 9. This <hi>Death</hi> was not prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for Men, for, or by reaſon of their ſinning in the firſt Publick Man ſimply; but for <hi>the Devil and his Angels:</hi> But they muſt go into it, and be hurt by it, who perſonally and voluntarily liſtned to, and were led by <hi>Satan,</hi> and followed after him, and did his Luſts, and died the <hi>firſt Death</hi> in ſuch tranſgreſſion: <hi>Mat.</hi> 25. 31-41-46. <hi>Of which ſecond Death they ſhall not be hurt, who overcome their ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual enemies: On ſuch the ſecond Death ſhall have no power:</hi> Rev. 2. 11. and Chap. 20. 6. But <hi>whoſoever ſhall not be found writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten in the book of life, will be caſt into the</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="tcp:185024:22"/>
               <hi>lake of fire, which is the ſecond death:</hi> Rev. 20. 14, 15. <hi>The fearful and unbelieving, and the abominable, and murderers, and whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers, and ſorcerers, and idolaters, and all lyars, ſhall have their part in the lake which burneth with fire and brimſtone, which is the ſecond death:</hi> Rev 21. 7, 8. This ſecond Death is called, <hi>the wrath to come;</hi> becauſe it will fully ſeize on none, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be brought out of the firſt Death, and judged by him who died for all, and roſe again; and whom God hath or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained the Judge of quick and dead: <hi>Mat.</hi> 3. 7. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 18.</p>
            <p>There are ſome indeed, and too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, that talk of a third Death, but in ſo doing, they ſpeak not according to the Word contained in the Law and Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of God<hi>:</hi> And therefore therein, <hi>there is no light in them.</hi> And that in ſpeaking of a third Death, as the wages of ſin, they conſent not to wholſom words, may eaſily appear to themſelves who uſe this groundleſs Diſtinction<hi>:</hi> for ſome of them, to prove that there is ſuch a third Death, do, weakly enough, bring the Scriptures which ſpeak of the ſecond, for the proof thereof. But it is a very evil and dangerous thing, to make ſuch
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:185024:22"/>
a Diſtinction, where the Scripture makes none, but plainly enough oppoſes and rejects it, and may do more harm than they are aware of, who make uſe of it; rather, I conceive, out of ignorance and cuſtom, than judgment and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It is good for us to hear what the Scripture faith, and to receive that. But no more to this at preſent.</p>
            <p>But now the Enquiry is, Of which of the two Deaths fore-mentioned, are we here to underſtand theſe words to mean? And to that we ſay, not of the firſt, which is now aboliſhed.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Becauſe it is Gods Will and Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment that all men ſhould die the firſt Death; (Though not that all ſhould ſleep, or abide in it: 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. 51, 52.) <hi>It is appointed to men once to die:</hi> Heb. 9. 27. <hi>I know,</hi> ſaith Job, <hi>Thou wilt bring me to death, and to the houſe appointed for all living:</hi> To wit, the Grave, which is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>Mans long home:</hi> Job 30. 23. with <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12. 5. <hi>What man is he that liveth, and ſhall not ſee death? Shall he deliver his ſoul from the hand of the grave? Selah.</hi> Pſal. 89. 48. with Eccleſ. 7. 2. and Chap. 8. 8.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Becauſe the Death here ſpoken of,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:185024:23"/>
is called, <hi>[the Death of the wicked;]</hi> as being their proper and onely Death: <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek.</hi> 18. 23. And therefore it appears, hereby is meant directly and fully, the ſecond Death, or Hell-fire. <hi>For the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> (ſo abiding) <hi>ſhall be turned into Hell:</hi> Pſal. 9. 17. whereas in the firſt Death there is no difference, but all die <hi>that,</hi> good and bad, wiſe, and unwiſe: <hi>How dieth the wiſe man? as the fool:</hi> Eccleſ. 2. 16. <hi>There is one event to the righteous, and to the wicked, to the good, and to the clean, and to the unclean, to him that ſacrificeth, and to him that ſacrificeth not. As is the good, ſo is the ſinner, and he that ſweareth, as he that feareth an oath:</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 1, 2-10. The moſt holy and righteous men generally have died this firſt Death; And ſome of them have ſaid, <hi>They were going the way of all the earth:</hi> meaning thereby; they were going to die the firſt Death<hi>: Joſh.</hi> 23. 14. 1 <hi>Kin.</hi> 2. 2. But none of them ſhall be hurt of the ſecond Death: <hi>Rev.</hi> 2. 11.</p>
            <p n="3">3. It alſo plainly appears, that by the Death here ſpoken of, we are to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the ſecond Death, directly and ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; becauſe this Death may, while it is called <hi>to Day,</hi> be eſcaped and avoided<hi>:</hi>
               <pb n="29" facs="tcp:185024:23"/>
as it is here ſignified in ſaying, <hi>[I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way, and live.]</hi> Men may now in this day of his Grace and Patience, <hi>flee from, and be delivered from, the wrath to come:</hi> Matth. 3. 7. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 10. But now, no man can by any turning from evil, or exerciſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf unto, and following after Godlineſs and Goodneſs, eſcape, or be delivered from the firſt Death: As hath been ſaid, <hi>No man hath power over the Spirit to retain the Spirit, neither hath he power in the day of death; and there is no diſcharge in that war:</hi> Eccleſ. 8. 8. By all which it doth plainly and fully appear, the Death here ſpoken of and intended, is directly, and moſt properly and fully, the ſecond Death; as hath been ſaid before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> If any one ſhould object a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt what hath been ſaid, and ſay, That though by the Death here ſpoken of; the firſt Death, as it was appointed to fallen Man after the Promiſe of Chriſt by God, cannot be meant; yet it may mean it of that Death, as it is judicially executed upon ſome for their voluntary and perſonal Iniquities and Tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons;
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:185024:24"/>
for ſo it was not appointed to all men to die it. To this I ſay,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. By way of Grant; God did not at firſt appoint that Men in a Perſonal Conſideration, or as fallen in <hi>Adam:</hi> or becauſe of their ſins of weakneſs and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adviſedneſs ſimply, ſhould die this firſt Death judicially. But,</p>
            <p>2. When Men are become wicked, and have ſinned with an high hand againſt God, he may, notwithſtanding their turning from their evils, order the firſt Death to them judicially; and they may not die the common Death of all men, or not die it, as commonly and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily men die it<hi>:</hi> But in teſtimony of wrath for their former perſonal evils, it may be executed upon them; <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 28, 29. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12-14. And ſometimes for the evils of others; As upon the little Ones in the old World<hi>:</hi> And of <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> &amp;c. So that ſtill, I ſay, By the Death here ſpoken of, is meant di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly and fully, the ſecond Death. And ſo we are to underſtand it, That God hath no pleaſure in the Death, that is, in the Eternal Deſtruction of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<hi>:</hi> Or that they ſhould periſh in that Everlaſting Fire which was prepared for
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:185024:24"/>
the Devil and his Angels, who ſinned without a Tempter. But we ſhall add no more to that.</p>
            <p>2. Who are <hi>[the wicked]</hi> in the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture account, in whoſe Death the Lord God hath no pleaſure?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that we may ſay; Thoſe who are called <hi>Wicked,</hi> in Scripture, are not ſuch ſimply, as have ſinned in the firſt Publick Man, and come forth into the World polluted and defiled, as all do who partake of the Nature of Man by an ordinary way of Generation? For <hi>who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean? not one:</hi> Job. 14. 4. and 25. 4. Pſal. 51. 5. Nor are they ſuch <hi>as have ſin in them</hi> ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; as all while here, have: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7. 17. 20. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 8. Or that ſin through infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and weakneſs, or through unad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſedneſs; as <hi>all</hi> do: <hi>For there is not a juſt man upon the earth that doth good, and ſinneth not:</hi> 1 Kin. 8. 46. Eccleſ. 8. 20. And yet <hi>all</hi> are not therefore wicked. Good men who have acknowledged themſelves to have ſinned, have yet truly acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves of being <hi>wicked:</hi> As <hi>Job</hi> thus acknowledgeth, <hi>I have ſinned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Job</hi> 7. 20. And yet he appealeth to God, and ſaith, <hi>Thou knoweſt</hi> (or, <hi>it is upon thy</hi>
               <pb n="32" facs="tcp:185024:25"/>
               <hi>knowledge) that I am not wicked:</hi> Job 7. 20. And God himſelf ſaith of him, <hi>That he was a perfect and an upright man, one that fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God and eſchewed evil:</hi> Job 1. 1-8. and Chap. 2, 3. And in affirming him to be a Perfect Man, he denies him to be Wicked; for perfect and wicked are contrary, and oppoſed the One to the Other: <hi>Job</hi> 9. 22. So certainly David was guilty of many evils, and ſaith, <hi>Mine iniquities are more than the hairs of my head:</hi> And prays to the Lord, <hi>not to remember against him the ſins of his youth, or his tranſgreſſions,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 25. 7. and 32. 4. 5. and 40. 12. And yet elſe-where he ſaith, <hi>I have kept the ways of the LORD, and have not [wickedly] departed from my God:</hi> Pſal. 18. 21. But, as is uſual in Scripture, <hi>the wicked</hi> are ſuch as are oppoſed to <hi>the righteous:</hi> And who they are we may a little more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſhew in what followeth<hi>:</hi> That is to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are <hi>wicked</hi> men in Scripture account, who <hi>hate the light,</hi> which comes to diſcover and reprove their evil deeds, and to ſave them there from; <hi>and rebel againſt the light:</hi> as <hi>Joh.</hi> 3. 19, 20. with <hi>Job.</hi> 24. 6-13-17. Such as ſay unto God, <hi>Depart from us, for we deſire not the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi>
               <pb n="33" facs="tcp:185024:25"/>
               <hi>of thy ways: What is the Almighty that we ſhould ſerve him? and what profit ſhould we have if we pray unto him?</hi> Job 21. 7-15. and 22. 15-17. They are ſuch as are Servants of Corruption, and led captive by Satan; and who ſtop their Ears, and harden their hearts from Gods fear<hi>: they are like to the deaf Adder which ſtoppeth her ears, which will not hearken to the voice of Charmers, charm they never ſo wiſely:</hi> Pſal. 58. 3-5. They are ſuch as <hi>hate instruction,</hi> (or, to be reformed) <hi>and caſt Gods words behind their backs:</hi> Pſal. 50. 16, 17. who will not ſeek after God, or the knowledge of him; and whoſe ways are always grievous<hi>:</hi> Pſal. 10 2-5. Such as contemn God, and harden their faces againſt him, and the fear of him: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 13. with <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 29. And hate and perſecute his People, who deſire to fear his Name: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 10. 2, 3. <hi>Mat.</hi> 4. 1-3. In ſhort, <hi>the whole World lieth in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> or, in the wicked One: even all ſuch as are not taught and led of God<hi>:</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 3. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. And indeed the word here tranſlated, <hi>wicked,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies <hi>unquiet, reſtleſs, turbulent ſinners;</hi> ſuch as are like <hi>the raging waves of the Sea, foming out their own ſhame, and know</hi>
               <pb n="34" facs="tcp:185024:26"/>
               <hi>no quietneſs in their belly.</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>The wicked are like the troubled Sea, when it cannot reſt, whoſe waters cast out mire and dirt: There is no peace, ſaith my God, to the wicked:</hi> Jude 13. and Job 20. 12-20. with <hi>Iſa.</hi> 57. 20, 21. And there are ſuch manner of perſons, not only without the Pale of the Church, but even amongſt Gods profeſſed People: there are too many Sinners and Hypocrites in <hi>Zion:</hi> Iſa. 33. 14. As the Lord ſaith, <hi>Among my people are found wicked men;</hi> yea, and ſuch as <hi>over-paſs the deeds of the wicked among the Heathen:</hi> Jer. 5. 23-26-29. they may be <hi>wicked ones, that come and go from the place of the holy:</hi> Eccl. 8. 10. As here alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in this Prophecy of <hi>Ezekiel</hi> in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny places, and in this Chapter; a part whereof we are conſidering: as is ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in what the Lord ſaith to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, to wit, <hi>Son of Man, I have ſet thee a Watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly die, if thou doſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity, but his blood will I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire at thine hand,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 33. 7, 8, 9. 14, 15, 16-19.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="35" facs="tcp:185024:26"/>
2. By <hi>[the wicked]</hi> alſo we may un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand, ſuch perſons as have once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the Grace of God to purpoſe, and turned unto him from their ſins and Idols, to ſerve the living and true God<hi>:</hi> And yet have afterwards treacherouſly departed from him; as a Wife trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cherouſly departeth from her Husband, and played the Harlot with other Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, after they have known God, or rather been known of him. Theſe are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo called <hi>wicked</hi> in Scripture; and are ſo in an higher degree, than ſuch as have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abidden Servants of ſin, and ſo in the ſtate and fellowſhip, and ways of the World. So it is ſaid of ſome who are cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>wicked, They have left off to be wiſe, and to do good:</hi> Pſal. 36. 1-3. Thus the Lord ſaith, <hi>Thine own wickedneſs ſhall cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect thee, and thy back-ſlidings ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thee: Know therefore and ſee, that it is an evil and bitter thing that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God, and that my fear is not in thee, ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.—Yet I had planted thee a noble Vine, wholly a right ſeed; how then art thou turned into the degenerate Plant of a ſtrange Vine unto me?</hi> Jer. 2. 2, 3-13-19-21. <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 9. 15. So that inceſtuous Believer that
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:185024:27"/>
turned to unheard of Fornication, <hi>in ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving his Fathers Wife,</hi> is called, <hi>that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon:</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 1-5-11-13. To which I ſhall not further enlarge.</p>
            <p>Now concerning ſuch wicked Ones, in both the fore-named Conſiderations, he here ſaith and ſweareth, <hi>He hath no pleaſure in the death of them.</hi> And it is obſervable, that it is not here ſaid; He hath no pleaſure in the Death of <hi>you wicked Ones;</hi> or, of ſome wicked Ones; or<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of ſuch wicked Ones as are Elect, or belong to the Election of Grace<hi>:</hi> For indeed, there are no wicked ones of the Elect, while they abide wicked; but <hi>the Elect of God are holy and beloved:</hi> Col. 3. 12. And ſuch as unto whom there is no condemnation from God, as there is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to all wicked Ones: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 33, 34. with <hi>verſe</hi> 1. Prov. 17. 15. And it is therefore a very erroneous and dangerous miſtake, to ſuppoſe that any wicked, while they are ſuch, are elected of God to Salvation. But here the Lord ſwears, <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked;</hi> inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely conſidered: And as is uſually ſaid, Indefinite Expreſſions are equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to general or univerſal ones; and ſo he hath no pleaſure in the Death of
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:185024:27"/>
any wicked ones. And though the Lord commands and charges the Prophet to ſpeak theſe words, unto <hi>the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> yet not onely of the houſe of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> for then, of what uſe would they be unto the ſinners of the <hi>Gentiles?</hi> When the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> writes to <hi>Timothy, That God will have all men to be ſaved.</hi> Though that be written to one man, yet it is matter of concernment unto <hi>all,</hi> and written for the good of <hi>all,</hi> in their reſpective Ages and Generations: 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2. 4-7. When <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith to the diſperſed Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, <hi>The Lord is willing that all ſhould come to repentance:</hi> He intends not theſe words concerning them onely, but more largely and extenſively, without all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. And the like may be ſaid here: Though the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the Prophet to ſay theſe words unto the houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> yet they are written for the ſake of others alſo<hi>: The Lord hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> indefinitely conſidered; not in the death of any wicked Ones<hi>:</hi> for he is one with whom is no reſpect of perſons. And indeed, if he had any pleaſure in the death of any wicked ones, it might rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably be conceived and concluded,
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:185024:28"/>
That he hath pleaſure in the death of the wicked in his Church; Becauſe their wickedneſs is greater, and more inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable than that of others<hi>:</hi> Becauſe they have more excellent and choice Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, Means, and gracious Aſſiſtances, than others have, to waſh their hearts and feet from wickedneſs, that they may be ſaved. And therefore if they continue ſinners, or treacherouſly depart from him, he is more highly diſpleaſed with them, and ſevere toward them: As it is ſaid, <hi>You onely have I known of all the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies of the earth, therefore will I puniſh you for all your iniquities:</hi> Amos 3. 2. Though indignation &amp; wrath, tribulation and anguiſh, will be upon every Soul of man that doth evil, yet it will be <hi>upon the Jew firſt,</hi> becauſe he hath much more advantage than the <hi>Gentile</hi> to be, and do better: And <hi>to whom much is given, of them will much be required:</hi> Rom. 2. 8-11. and Chap. 3. 1, 2. <hi>Luke</hi> 12. 47, 48. When <hi>in the times of ignorance God winks; his eyes are upon all their ways,</hi> (who have choice means of knowledge vouchſafed to them) <hi>they are not hid from his face, neither is their iniquity hid from his eyes: And firſt he will recompenſe their iniquity,</hi>
               <pb n="39" facs="tcp:185024:28"/>
               <hi>and their ſin double, becauſe they have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed his land,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Acts</hi> 17. 30. with <hi>Jer.</hi> 16. 16-18. So that theſe words being di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly ſpoken unto, though not confined unto <hi>the houſe of Iſrael;</hi> do more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully aſcertain, that he hath no pleaſure in the death of any other: And are, as it were, a powerful Argument to evince the truth thereof. He who hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the everlaſting Ruine and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of ſuch as ſin againſt the cleareſt Light, greateſt Grace, and choiceſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages; to be ſure he hath none in their eternal Perdition, who have not ſuch Means and Advantages for knowing and ſerving him: <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 20-24. If he be ſo compaſſionate towards the greateſt Tranſgreſſors, and be altogether unwilling that they ſhould die; how can we ſuppoſe but that he is loath and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing they ſhould periſh, who are not ſuch hainous Offenders? even as the Apoſtle ſignifies to us, that <hi>he, who was the chief of ſinners, obtained mercy, that in him first, Jeſus Chriſt might ſhew forth all long-ſuffering for a Pattern,</hi> (to ſuch as were not ſuch great ſinners) even <hi>to them that ſhould delay to believe on him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life everlaſting:</hi> 1 Tim. 1. 13, 14, 15, 16.
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:185024:29"/>
So we may alſo here underſtand it. But what is ſaid may ſuffice to the ſecond Inquiry; and we ſhall deſire to proceed unto the next, namely,</p>
            <p n="3">3. What are we to underſtand by this Phraſe, <hi>[no pleaſure?]</hi> And to that we ſay, hereby is meant and ſignified, That it is not at all delightful, or well-pleaſing unto him, that ſuch as are wicked Ones ſhould be deſtroyed with an everlaſting Deſtruction<hi>:</hi> As <hi>he is a God that hath no pleaſure in wickedneſs, neither ſhall evil dwell with him:</hi> Pſal. 5. 4-6. And as <hi>he hath no pleaſure in fools,</hi> or <hi>wicked ones:</hi> Eccl. 5. 4. So alſo, <hi>he hath no delight, or pleaſure in the death of the wicked;</hi> As he here ſwears unto us, <hi>he hath no pleaſure, none at all:</hi> That is to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. He hath <hi>no Revealed Pleaſure</hi> in the Death of the wicked; that Revelation he hath given of his heart and mind in the holy Scriptures, declares no ſuch will, or well-pleaſedneſs in him, or affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction to any ſuch thing; but the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereto<hi>:</hi> As plainly appears in that Scripture we are conſidering.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Nor hath he any <hi>ſecret plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, will, or delight therein:</hi> As appears by this Revelation of his Will which he
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:185024:29"/>
hath given forth to the Sons of Men<hi>:</hi> He ſpeaks thus to us, and by his Oath aſſures us of the truth of it, who onely perfectly knows himſelf, which we do not<hi>:</hi> for <hi>we cannot by ſearching find out God, we cannot find out the Almighty to perfection:</hi> Job 11. 7-9. But he <hi>who is perfect in the knowledge of himſelf, and all things,</hi> (as Job 36. 4.) And perfectly knows his own Mind and Will, ſaith, and ſwears, <hi>that he hath no pleaſure:</hi> And his mouth herein, &amp; in all things, ſpeaks truth; for it is impoſſible for him to lye<hi>: Tit.</hi> 1. 2. <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>Yea, let God be true, and every man a lyar:</hi> Rom. 3. 4. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, the word here tranſlated <hi>[Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure]</hi> ſignifies <hi>inward intention, delight, affection, well pleaſedneſs.</hi> And oh! let us not be faithleſs, but believing; let us give glory to him, in believing him when he thus ſolemnly ſwears, <hi>I live, ſaith the Lord God, if I will, or be well-pleaſed in the Death of the wicked.</hi> That is, as it is rendred with us, and ſuitable to ſuch like manner of ſpeakings in other pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; <hi>I have no pleaſure in their death.</hi> So what is thus expreſſed in one place, <hi>I ſware in my wrath, if they ſhould enter into my reſt:</hi> Is thus expreſt and explained in
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:185024:30"/>
another by the holy Spirit; <hi>He ſware that they ſhould not enter into his reſt.</hi> Compare <hi>Pſal</hi> 95. 11. and <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 11. with <hi>verſe</hi> 18. <hi>Mark</hi> 8. 12. with <hi>Mat.</hi> 16. 4.</p>
            <p>And what hath been now ſaid, may in ſome meaſure, deliver us from entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a very corrupt and pernicious Gloſs, which too many have put upon this Scripture, and others that are like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to it; namely,</p>
            <p>Some ſay, <hi>It is true indeed, God hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked:</hi> That is, ſay they, <hi>He hath no Revealed Will or Pleaſure therein; his Revealed Will is, That all men ſhould be ſaved: But his Secret Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, or the Will of his good Pleaſure is, that the most of men ſhould periſh, and be eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally miſerable; and therefore he reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, or paſt them by, before they were born; ſo as in concluſion, they must una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably have their Portion in that ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting fire prepared for the Devil and his Angels.</hi> And in thus ſpeaking, they plainly ſignifie, <hi>That his Revealed and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will, are contrary the one to the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> Now for Anſwer thereto, and to diſcover a little the Evil and Perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs of that Diſtinction, or Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion rather, of the Will of God; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:185024:30"/>
we diligently theſe things: To wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It ſavours of high Preſumption, and Daringneſs of Spirit, to give out that God hath <hi>a Secret Will contrary to his Revealed Will:</hi> For if his Will be Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret, how come they to know it, or ro know that it is contrary to that Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his Mind and Will he hath vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to us? Or why may not others as well know that ſecret Will they ſpeak of, as themſelves? For in truth none knows what his Will is, any further than it is Revealed; nor doth it appertain to any to know it: And they who would be prying there-into, <hi>intrude into things they have not ſeen, being vainly puft up with their fleſhly mind:</hi> as Col. 2. 18, 19. <hi>The ſecret things belong unto the Lord our God; but thoſe things which are revealed unto us, and to our Children for ever; that we may do all the words of this Law:</hi> Deut. 29. 29. It is a very ſinful and dangerous thing for us, to be peeping into things that God hath kept ſecret. We may remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber how ſeverely God dealt with <hi>Fifty thouſand threeſcore and ten men of</hi> Beth-ſhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſh, <hi>becauſe they looked into the Ark of the Lord:</hi> 1 Sam. 6. 19, 20. And that is
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:185024:31"/>
written for our Admonition; to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent <hi>our hearts might not be haughty, nor our eyes lofty:</hi> And that we ſhould not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe our ſelves in great Matters, or in things too wonderful for us<hi>:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 6-11. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 131. Who hath aſcended up into Heaven, or deſcended? <hi>Prov.</hi> 30. 4. The Angel ſhewed his diſlike of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noah</hi>'s Queſtion, when he asked him, <hi>What is thy Name?</hi> And ſaid unto him, <hi>Why askeſt thou thus after my Name, ſeeing it is Secret,</hi> or <hi>Wonderful?</hi> Judg. 13. 18. And our Saviour reproves his Apoſtles for their curioſity, in demanding of him, <hi>Lord, wilt thou at this time reſtore the Kingdom unto</hi> Iſrael? <hi>It is not for you,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to know the times, or the ſeaſons which the Father hath put in his own power:</hi> Acts 1. 6, 7. And if it be Reprovable to enquire into, or after, Secret Things, much more Condemnable is it to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume to know and declare, what Gods Secret Will is: And more ſtill, to give out that it is contrary to his Revealed; as may be after ſhewn. As with reſpect to Secret and Wonderful things, it is good and ſafe for us to ſay, as ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>David</hi> doth, when he is ſpeaking of the Omniſcience and Preſcience of
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:185024:31"/>
God; <hi>Such knowledge is too wonderful,</hi> or <hi>ſecret for me, it is high, I cannot attain unto it.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, It is ſuch as is impoſſible for me to comprehend, ſuch as mine Underſtanding cannot reach un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39. 1-6.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Time was, when that which is now Revealed and made known to us, was Secret and hidden alſo: <hi>It was hid in God:</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 6. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3. 9. And if his Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Will be contrary to his Secret; Time was when he had two Secret Wills, one inconſiſtent with, or contrary to the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: One having no Pleaſure in the Death of the wicked; and the other ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving Pleaſure in the Death of the greateſt part of Mankind. And how unworthily and wickedly do they herein ſpeak of of God,: yea, as it were ſay, <hi>There are two Gods:</hi> Whereas, <hi>the Lord our God, is one Lord?</hi> Deut. 6. 4, 5. Or that he is divided from himſelf; or one Secret Will divided from the other? Whereas he is One<hi>: Gal.</hi> 3. 20. Or, <hi>in one Mind and Will, and who can turn him?</hi> Job 23. 13. <hi>He is</hi> Jehovah, <hi>he changeth not:</hi> Mal. 3. 6. <hi>Do not err, my beloved brethren; every good giving, and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father</hi>
               <pb n="46" facs="tcp:185024:32"/>

            <p n="3">3. This wicked Diſtinction of the Will or Wills of God, makes him guilty of Diſſimulation and Hypocriſie, which are moſt hateful and abominable to him in others; and without all doubt, he is moſt clear thereof himſelf: for it makes him to ſpeak one thing, and mean ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther<hi>:</hi> And though his Lips drop as the Honey-comb, and his Mouth be ſmoother than Oyl, yet war is in his heart toward the moſt of men, toward whom he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth ſo much love: (as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 55. 21.) <hi>Burning Lips,</hi> (ſuch as ſpeak kindly, and pretend fervent love:) <hi>And a wicked heart,</hi> (which is full of hatred) <hi>are like a Pot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheard covered with ſilver-droſs: he that hateth, diſſembleth with his lips, and layeth up deceit within him: when he maketh his voice gracious, believe him not: for there are ſeven abominations in his heart; whoſe ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred is covered by deceit; his wickedneſs ſhall be ſhewed before the whole Congregation:</hi> Prov. 26. 23-26. And God forbid that we ſhould ſuppoſe, that <hi>He who hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in uprightneſs,</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 17. And
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:185024:32"/>
who is <hi>the moſt upright:</hi> Iſa. 26. 7. ſhould be guilty of that which is ſo hateful and abominable to him in others. Our Lord Jeſus, who is the Brightneſs of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers Glory, and the Expreſs Character of his Perſon, in ſeeing whom we ſee the Father alſo<hi>:</hi> Though he hated all Iniquity, yet moſt ſeverely enveighed againſt, and denounced Woes upon thoſe who were guilty of Diſſimulation and Hypocriſie: <hi>Matth.</hi> 23. And therefore, without controverſie, this is moſt hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful unto the Divine Majeſty; and ſo hateful, <hi>that an Hypocrite ſhall not come before him:</hi> Job 13. 16. And for ſuch, ſo remaining, the Blackneſs of Darkneſs, as it were, is reſerved<hi>: Mat.</hi> 24. 51. But now, if God were guilty hereof, (which is moſt abominable to conceive) then we might alſo be ſafely guilty thereof; for we are exhorted <hi>to be followers of God, as dear children:</hi> Eph. 5. 1. And our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour inſtructs and commands his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples <hi>to be Children of their father which is in Heaven, in loving their enemies:</hi> Not to have a mouth full of Love, and an heart full of Hatred towards them<hi>:</hi> But ſincerely and cordially to love them; adding preſently, <hi>Be ye perfect, as your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi>

               <hi>which is in Heaven is perfect:</hi> And then preſently cautions them that they ſhould not be, or do as the Hypocrites<hi>:</hi> But in all their love, and expreſſions of kindneſs towards their Enemies, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, ſhould be hearty; and have their <hi>Converſation in the world, and one toward another in ſimplicity, and in the ſincerity of God:</hi> Mat. 5. 44-48. and Chap. 6. 1, 2. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> with 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 12. Oh<hi>!</hi> take we heed we attribute not Lying, or Diſſimulation to him, who though he can do all things which are Acts of Power or Potency, for he is the Almighty; yet <hi>cannot poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly Lye,</hi> or be <hi>guilty of Hypocriſie;</hi> for that is an Act of Infirmity and Impotency<hi>: Heb.</hi> 6. 18. <hi>The four living Creatures</hi> thus <hi>give Glory to God, ſaying, Holy, Holy, Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, Lord God Almighty.</hi> To aſſure us, <hi>that he is holily Almighty, and Almightily ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</hi> And ſuch an One <hi>he was, and is to come;</hi> even from Everlaſting to Everlaſting<hi>: Rev.</hi> 4. 8, 9.</p>
            <p n="4">4. This ungodly Diſtinction is juſtly chargeable with Non-ſence: for while ſome ſpeak of Gods <hi>Revealed Will;</hi> what do they mean thereby, but that it is <hi>the Revelation of his Will, which is more hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den:</hi> or the manifeſting, or making
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:185024:33"/>
known of his Will which is ſecret? Now how can that be rationally called his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will, or the Revelation of his Will, which is diſagreeing with, and contrary to, his Secret Will? But indeed, as <hi>evil men, who have not the faith</hi> of Chriſt, <hi>are unreaſonable and abſurd:</hi> As the Apoſtle gives us to underſtand<hi>:</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3. 3. So are alſo all thoſe corrupt Notions and Diſtinctions which <hi>conſent not to wholſom words, the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and the Doctrine which is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Godlineſs:</hi> 1 Tim 6. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p n="5">5. This unworthy and unreaſonable Diſtinction tends to over-throw the Faith, and gives men ground to believe God in nothing he Aſſerts or Promiſes<hi>:</hi> For if he hath a Secret Will, and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will, in one thing Repugnant the one to the other, then why not in every thing? And whatever be propounded to us ftom the Scriptures, to encourage us to believe and hope in God, may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently be repelled and rejected with this Diſtinction: As to ſay, when with the Apoſtle we ſay, <hi>God our Saviour will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 3, 4. Yes, ſay ſome, He wills this with his Reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:185024:34"/>
Will, but not with his Secret. And why may not others make uſe of this Diſtinction elſe-where? As when our Saviour ſaith, <hi>He that believeth and is baptized, ſhall be ſaved; and he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth not ſhall be damned.</hi> May not this Diſtinction of Gods two Wills be here brought in by ſome, as rationally as where it is? And may they not ſay, This is his Revealed Will, but his Secret Will agrees not therewith<hi>: Mark</hi> 16. 16. Or where our Saviour ſaith, <hi>This is the Will of him that ſent me, that every one that ſeeth the Son, and believeth on him, may have everlaſting life; and I will raiſe him up at the last day:</hi> John 6. 40. Very true, may ſome alſo here ſay, This is his Revealed Will; but this is not his Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret Will: And by this latter, ſuch may periſh, and not have everlaſting life<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> were this Diſtinction good and right<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Whereas indeed, it is moſt corrupt and pernicious, and to be abominated by us; for it makes <hi>the Pen of the Scribe in vain: By this Tradition the Word of God is made of none effect,</hi> as to all therein Aſſerted, or Aſſured: as <hi>Jer.</hi> 8. 8, 9. <hi>Mark</hi> 7. 9-13.</p>

               <hi>the Heirs of Promiſe;</hi> to wit, to all hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Believers, that they ſhall be happy and bleſſed for ever; to the end <hi>they might have ſtrong conſolation, who have fled for refuge to lay hold on the hope ſet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them:</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 17, 18.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To that I ſay, Doth not God here alſo bind himſelf with an <hi>Oath of Confirmation,</hi> as is before ſaid; <hi>that he hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?</hi> And is not his Oath as valid and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentick here as there? Yes doubtleſs<hi>:</hi> and if by the force of the Diſtinction we are diſproving and oppoſing, his Oath may be fruſtrated in one place, why may it not alſo be ſo in another, and in a third; and in all thoſe places and caſes wherein he hath interpoſed himſelf by his Oath? Let this be duly minded and conſidered by us.</p>
            <p n="6">6. And laſtly as to this; Our Lord Jeſus, who is in the Boſom of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and who knows the Father, as the Father knows him; who knows his Mind and Will, and hath declared him and it to us in theſe laſt Ages, more plainly than he was made known in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer times<hi>:</hi> He, I ſay, doth aſſure us, That his Fathers Secret Will is a Gracious Will
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:185024:35"/>
toward the worſt of men, while it is to day; And that as he hath ſaid and ſworn, <hi>That he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked:</hi> which is, as they ſpeak, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed Will: So alſo his Secret Will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly accords therewith; and by this alſo <hi>he is not willing that any ſhould periſh.</hi> To this purpoſe our Lord ſpake while he was on the Earth<hi>: The Son of Man,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is come to ſave that which was lost: How think ye? If a man have an hundred ſheep, and one of them be gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtray,; doth he not leave the ninety and nine, and goeth into the mountains, and ſeeketh that which is gone aſtray? And if ſo be that he find it, verily I ſay unto you, he rejoyceth more of that ſheep, than of the ninety and nine which went not aſtray.</hi> Which Parable, our Lord in another E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſt ſpeaks, concerning <hi>the Publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans and Sinners;</hi> who were, and were lookt upon to be notorious ſinners. And then it is added, (as the Application of the former;) <hi>Even ſo, it is not the will of your Father which is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="3 letters">

               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:185024:35"/>
               <hi>that one of theſe little Ones ſhould pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.</hi> Which is in ſubſtance the ſame, as to have ſaid, <hi>Your Father hath no ſecret will or pleaſure in the death of loſt Ones, of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licans, of notorious ſinners.</hi> Nay, he hath no ſecret will in their death, not onely as indefinitely and generally conſidered; but alſo, he hath no pleaſure in their death individually conſidered: I mean, not in the death of any One of them<hi>: There is not a Will before him that One of them ſhould be loſt.</hi> Let this be ſeriouſly conſidered, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 11-14. with <hi>Luke</hi> 15. 1-7-24. Now here our Saviour, who perfectly knows what his Fathers Secret Will is, and who onely doth ſo; for <hi>none knows the Father, ſave the Son:</hi> Matt. 11. 27. <hi>Luke</hi> 10. 24. plainly aſſures us, that Gods Secret Will, or that Will which is before him in the Heavens, is <hi>good-will</hi> towards every ſinful loſt Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of Mankind<hi>:</hi> as <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 10-14. And we are required, <hi>to hear him in all things whatſoever he ſpeaks unto us. And,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle <hi>Peter, It ſhall come to paſs, that every Soul which will not hear this Prophet, ſhall be deſtroyed from among the people:</hi> Matth. 17. 5. with 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 17. <hi>Acts</hi> 3. 22, 23. Oh! let us then give this Honour to
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:185024:36"/>
our Lord Jeſus, and unto his Father, <hi>to hear his Word, and believe on him that ſent him:</hi> According to that Revelation he hath given of his Father; and <hi>ſo we ſhall have everlaſting life, and not come into condemnation,</hi> &amp;c. John 5. 23, 24. And in ſo doing, we ſhall be led to reject and abominate this ungodly Diſtinction<hi>:</hi> and be aſſured, That Gods Secret Will is as Gracious towards ſinful wicked Ones, as is his Revealed Will: Yea let me ſay, his Secret Will is more Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than is contained in any Revelation of it<hi>:</hi> For as his Power, Wiſdom, Truth, and Holineſs, are infinite and unſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, ſo as they are not fully Revealed and manifeſted to us in any Revelation vouchſafed<hi>: Rom.</hi> 11. 33. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 9. So his Merciful-kindneſs is greater toward poor ſinners, than is expreſt in any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation given to us: Or then that it can be conceived, much more expreſt by fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite Creatures<hi>: The Love of Chriſt,</hi> who is One with the Father, <hi>paſſeth know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge:</hi> Eph. 3. 18, 19. Hence we ſee how the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> magnifies the <hi>Mercy</hi> of God, and ſaith, <hi>It is great unto the Heavens:</hi> Pſal. 57. 10. <hi>In the Heavens,</hi> Pſal 36. 1-5. Nay, <hi>It is above the Heavens, great above</hi>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:185024:36"/>
               <hi>the Heavens:</hi> And therefore he reſolved <hi>to ſing Praiſes unto him among the people, and among the heathen:</hi> Pſalm 108. 3, 4. And when he thus ſaith; <hi>Thy Righteouſneſs is like the great Mountains,</hi> or, <hi>Mountains of God, thy Judgments are a great deep:</hi> He preſently adds thereto by way of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration, <hi>How excellent is thy Loving-kindneſs, O God!</hi> To wit, toward the Children of Men: As if he would inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate to us, and to our ſhallow Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, That though he could compare Gods Righteouſneſs and Judgments to ſomewhat; yet his Mercy, or Merciful-kindneſs, is admirably, inconceivably, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparably Great; ſo as he knew not what to compare that unto: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36. 6, 7. and 144. 3, 4. and 145. 8, 9. And doth not our Bleſſed Saviour ſpeak alſo after ſuch a rate, when he ſaith, <hi>So God loved the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 3. 16. 1 <hi>John</hi> 4. 11. So that from what hath been ſaid, we do and may ſafely conclude, <hi>That the LORD GOD hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, none at all:</hi> Not onely, <hi>no Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed pleaſure</hi> therein<hi>:</hi> But alſo <hi>no Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret,</hi> or hidden Will or <hi>Pleaſure</hi> therein; as he ſwears unto us.</p>
            <p>And what hath been ſaid about this
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:185024:37"/>
Third Enquiry meets with, and gives Anſwer unto another evil Diſtinction, and Oppoſition of ſome, againſt the Current of the Goſpel: Namely, ſay ſome, It is true indeed, <hi>God hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light or pleaſure in the death of the wicked, ſimply conſidered: But he hath pleaſure therein Reſpectively; to wit, in order to the manifeſtation of the Glory of his Juſtice.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer,</hi> Now to this I ſay briefly, <hi>If he hath pleaſure in their Death,</hi> or in the Death of ſome of them, <hi>in order to the manifeſtation of the Glory of his Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or Juſtice;</hi> then he hath ſome plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their Death: for as is uſually ſaid, <hi>He that wills the End, wills the Means con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing thereto.</hi> And ſo alſo it is in this particular, if their evil Diſtinction were true, as indeed it is not<hi>:</hi> But in their ſo ſaying, they contradict this Text, and deny the truth of Gods Oath, who ſwears by himſelf, <hi>by his life, That he hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked.</hi> And beſides, God needs not the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of any of Mankind for the Glory of his Juſtice; for the Glory of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs is manifeſted in giving to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry One according to his works<hi>:</hi> And ſo in Acts of Grace and Mercy toward
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:185024:37"/>
men, that they might Repent; and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſuch as do turn to him from their Iniquities: <hi>Gracious is the Lord and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous, yea our God is merciful:</hi> Pſ. 116. 5. <hi>If we confeſs our ſins, he is faithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all unrighteouſneſs:</hi> 1 Joh. 1. 9. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1. 5. And his Mercy is magnified in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying implacable and impenitent ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: As it is ſaid, <hi>He over-threw,</hi> or <hi>ſhaked off Pharaoh and his Hoſt in the Red-Sea: for his mercy endureth for ever.—Who ſmote great Kings, for his mercy endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for ever. And ſlew famous Kings, for his mercy endureth for ever:</hi> Pſal. 136. 15-20. But we ſhall add no more unto the Third Enquiry, but conſider the next; namely,</p>
            <p>4. <hi>When, or during what time,</hi> hath he no pleaſure, none at all, neither Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, nor Secret, in the Death and everlaſting Deſtruction of the wicked, Indefinitely conſidered?</p>
            <p>And to that we may ſay, It is plainly intimated to us in the Words as they are rendred with us; <hi>During what time</hi> he hath no Will, Pleaſure, or Delight in their Death; namely, <hi>Now, in this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Day of his Grace and Patience:</hi> As it is
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:185024:38"/>
here expreſſed, <hi>[I have] no pleaſure,</hi> &amp;c. To wit, while it is called to Day<hi>:</hi> As the Holy Goſt ſaith, <hi>To Day if you will hear his Voice, harden not your hearts, as in the provocation,</hi> &amp;c. Heb. 3. 7, 8. and Ch. 4. 7. All the time Chriſt is interceding for Tranſgreſſors in Heaven; and that is, while he is vouchſafing Gracious Means to them on Earth<hi>: Behold, now is the accepted time; Behold, now is the day of ſalvation:</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 20. with Chap, 6. 1, 2. According to what the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to repentance:</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. Indeed this time or ſeaſon will not laſt always; his <hi>Spirit will not always ſtrive with men:</hi> as <hi>Gen.</hi> 6. 3. When once the Day of Grace is fully ended, he that now ſwears he hath no pleaſure in their Death, <hi>will ſwear in his wrath, that they ſhall not enter into his reſt:</hi> as Heb. 3. 7-11, He will then have pleaſure in their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction<hi>:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>Becauſe ye have ſet at naught all my counſel, and would none of my reproof: I alſo will laugh at your ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity, I will mock when your fear cometh; when your fear cometh as deſolation, and your deſtruction cometh as a whirlwind:</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="tcp:185024:38"/>
               <hi>when diſtreſs and anguiſh cometh upon you: Then ſhall they call upon me, but I will not anſwer; they ſhall ſeek me early, but they ſhall not find me: For that they hated know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and did not chooſe the fear of the Lord: They would none of my counſel, they depiſed all my reproof: Therefore they ſhall eat of the fruit of their own ways, and be filled with their own devices:</hi> Prov. 1. 24-26-31. Then, <hi>He that made them will not have mercy upon them, and he that formed them, will ſhew them no favour:</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 27. 11. And when he pleaſes, he can put an end to that Day, and to mens Lives; for their times are in his Hand; to continue, or cut off, as is good before him. The Conſideration whereof is proper and powerful to excite us all, <hi>to ſeek the Lord while he may be found, and to call up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him while he is near:</hi> Iſa. 55. 6. To make haſte, and not delay to keep Gods Commandments: For, <hi>if he cut off, or ſhut up, or gather together, then who can hinder him? No man hath power over the Spirit,</hi> (his own, or God's) <hi>to retain the Spirit, neither hath he power in the day of Death: And there is no caſting of Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons in that War; neither ſhall wickedneſs deliver them that are given to it:</hi> Eccl. 8. 8.
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:185024:39"/>
Now therefore in the opportune ſeaſon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> turn we from our Iniquities, that we may underſtand his truth, <hi>For in the Grave whither we are a going, there is no work nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom:</hi> Eccleſ. 9. 10. Then there will be <hi>a great Gulf fixed,</hi> ſo as there will be no poſſibility of paſſing from one ſtate to another<hi>: What-ever our hand</hi> therefore <hi>finds to do, let us do it with our might;</hi> in the preſent opportunity. To this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and upon this account, our Lord thus inſtructs and counſels<hi>: Strive</hi> (ſaith he, to wit, in the preſent time) <hi>to enter in at the ſtrait gate; for many, I ſay un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you, will ſeek to enter in;</hi> (namely when it is too late) <hi>and ſhall not be able. When once the Maſter of the houſe is riſen up, and ſhut to the door, and ye begin to ſtand with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, and to knock at the door, ſaying, Lord, Lord, open unto us: And he ſhall anſwer and ſay unto you, I know you not whence you are,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 13. 24-29. Mat. 25. 10-13. But now, I ſay, while God is wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he may be gracious unto ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, he hath no pleaſure, none at all in their eternal Ruine and Perdition<hi>: Iſa.</hi> 30. 8-18. And ſo, <hi>ſurely to him that is joyned to all the living, there is hope:</hi> Eccl.
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:185024:39"/>
9. 4. The very end of Chriſt in ſo loving all men, as to die for them, was, <hi>That they which live,</hi> (who are ſtill continued in the land of, and joyned to all the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving) <hi>might no longer live unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, but unto him who died for them, and roſe again:</hi> 2. Cor. 5. 14, 15. Yea though Sinners and ungodly Ones have long per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted in their folly and diſobedience, yet while he is long-ſuffering, it is <hi>a Day of Salvation:</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9-15. And unto ſuch Wiſdom utters her Voice, ſaying, <hi>How long ye ſimple Ones, will ye love ſimplicity? and the Scorners delight in their ſcorning? and Fools hate knowledge? Turn ye at my reproof,</hi> &amp;c. Prov. 1. 21, 22, 23. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 1, 2. Even as our Lord Jeſus ſpeaks, and ſaith, <hi>If any man here my words, and believe not, I judge him not.</hi> (To wit, now he doth not judge him, as that is oppoſed to <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving:</hi> he doth not ſay, he will never judge him, for he will hereafter judge all, and yield Vengeance unto all that know not God, and obey not his Goſpel; who will be puniſhed with everlaſting Deſtruction from the Preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his Power: as 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1, 7, 8, 9. <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 40, 41.

ſaith, <hi>I judge him not:)</hi> John 12. 47-49. Hence the <hi>Wiſdom of God</hi> thus ſpeaks un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to men, and unto the Sons of <hi>Adam,</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definitely conſidered; and ſaith, <hi>They that ſeek me early,</hi> (to wit, while it is called to Day) <hi>ſhall find me:</hi> And thus exhorts them, <hi>Now therefore,</hi> (to wit, in the opportune ſeaſon) <hi>hearken unto me: for bleſſed are they that obſerve my ways:</hi> Prov. 8. 1-4, 5. 17. 32, 33.

            <p>And thus we have ſpoken unto the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, or explaining of thoſe four things we propounded to Enquire into which we deſire may be duly minded and diligently conſidered<hi>:</hi> And ſhall now pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed on unto the next conſiderable; to wit,</p>
            <p>2. We come nextly, to give ſome fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Evidence and Proof of the Truth of what the Lord God here ſo ſolemnly ſwears to, namely, <hi>That he hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death of the wicked.</hi> Though indeed, his Word and Oath here given
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:185024:40"/>
us, are ſuch <hi>Immutable Things,</hi> and <hi>Infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Proofs,</hi> as may ſufficiently aſſure us of the Verity of what is ſo Affirmed and Confirmed. But we have not onely this Scripture ſpeaking ſuch gracious Words, but others alſo, much-what to the ſame purpoſe. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Have I any plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure at all,</hi> (either Revealed, or Secret) <hi>in the Death of the wicked, ſaith the Lord God?</hi> Indeed, this is propounded by way of Queſtion, or Interrogation<hi>:</hi> But, as is uſually obſerved, is a vehement De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of that queſtioned about. And to put all out of doubt, he who propounds the Queſtion, and beſt, and onely perfectly knows his own Will and Pleaſure, gives Anſwer hereto in the ſame Chapter, and ſaith poſitively, <hi>I have no pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God,</hi> &amp;c. Ezek. 18. 23. with <hi>verſe</hi> 32. And we have the two famous Apoſtles, the Apoſtle of the Uncircumciſion, and the Apoſtle of the Circumciſion, ſpeaking after the ſame rate: The former ſaith thus, <hi>God our Saviour will have all men to be ſaved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth:</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 3, 4. The latter thus, <hi>The Lord is long-ſuffering to us-ward, not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all</hi>
               <pb n="64" facs="tcp:185024:41"/>
               <hi>ſhould come to repentance?</hi> 2 Pet. 3. 9. And theſe Scriptures conſidered together, more confirm the truth of this Doctrine<hi>:</hi> And, <hi>this three-fold Cord is not quickly bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken.</hi> But I ſhall deſire to add ſome other Proofs and Evidences to Aſſure us of the Truth hereof: Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It appears Evidently, <hi>That God hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked,</hi> nor of any ſinful Creature of Mankind, while it is called <hi>to Day;</hi> in that, according to his Promiſe, he hath actually raiſed up a <hi>Saviour,</hi> even Jeſus: <hi>This Purpoſe and Grace was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the ſecular times; but is now manifested by the appearing of our Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Tim. 1. 9, 10. <hi>When the fulneſs of the time was come God ſent forth his Son, made of a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, made under the Law; to redeem them that were under the Law:</hi> Gal. 4, 4, 5. Which was an high Act, Evidence, and Expreſſion of the Love of God towards the Sons of Men<hi>:</hi> As our Saviour ſaith, <hi>So God loved the World,</hi> (to wit, of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind) <hi>that he gave his onely begotten Son; that whoſoever believeth in him might not periſh, but have everlasting life. For God ſent not his Son into the World to condemn the World, but that the World thorow him might</hi>
               <pb n="65" facs="tcp:185024:41"/>
               <hi>be ſaved:</hi> John 3. 16. 7. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the World to ſave ſinners:</hi> Indefinitely conſidered; 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 15. <hi>In this was manifeſted the love of God toward us, becauſe that God ſent his onely begotten Son into the world, that we might live thorow him. Herein is love, not that we loved God, but that he loved us, and ſent his Son the Propitiation for our ſins; he ſent the Son the Saviour of the World:</hi> 1 John 4. 8, 9, 10-14. And Jeſus Chriſt, by the will of God his Father, came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World, <hi>not to destroy mens Souls, but to ſave them:</hi> Luk. 9 55, 56. To which end, <hi>He</hi> in the Greatneſs of his Love, <hi>died for all,</hi> even for all of Mankind that were dead: 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5. 14, 15. And, <hi>God crowned him with glory and honour, that he by the grace of God ſhould taste death for every man:</hi> Heb. 2. 9. And, <hi>he roſe again for their juſtification:</hi> Rom. 4. 15. and Ch. 3. 23, 24. and Ch. 5. 6-8. 12. 18.</p>
            <p>Now herein is clearly and undoubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly evidenced, That God hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death of any of Mankind, while it is called to Day; In that <hi>he hath deviſed ſuch a Device,</hi> and done what he deviſed, <hi>that his Baniſhed might</hi>
               <pb n="66" facs="tcp:185024:42"/>
               <hi>not be expelled from him:</hi> as 2 Sam. 14. 14. When Chriſt was born into the World, one Angel ſaith unto the Shepherds, <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold, I bring you glad-tidings of great joy, which ſhall be to all people: for unto you</hi> (Men, and not unto the Angels, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2. 9. 16.) <hi>is born this day a Saviour,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—And the multitude of the heavenly hoſt praiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed God, and ſaid, Glory to God in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, on earth peace, good will towards men:</hi> Luke 2. 10, 11-14. And hereby the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle <hi>Paul</hi> doth prove and demonſtrate, <hi>That God our Saviour will have all men to be ſaved;</hi> (And therefore hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Deſtruction of any of them;) <hi>Becauſe there is one Med<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

And upon this ground, the worſt of ſinners are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted and excited to turn to the Lord<hi>: Behold,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I have given him for a Witneſs to the People,</hi> (even Chriſt, as delivered for our Offences, and raiſed again for our Juſtification:) There cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, <hi>The ſure mercies of</hi> David: <hi>Iſa.</hi> 55. 3, 4. with <hi>Acts</hi> 13. 34. And then preſently after, and upon that account, he cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth Sinners to Repentance<hi>: Seek ye the</hi>
               <pb n="67" facs="tcp:185024:42"/>
               <hi>LORD, while he may be found, call upon him while he is neer. Let the wicked forſake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts, and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will multiply to pardon:</hi> Iſa. 55. 3, 4-6, 7. This bleſſed Doctrine the Apoſtle preached unto the <hi>Corinthians, when they were carried away unto dumb Idols,</hi> and were notorious ſinners; to wit, Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cators, Idolaters, Adulterers, Effemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, Abuſers of themſelves with Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To aſſure them, that God hath no pleaſure in their Death: And to the end they might be ſaved, <hi>He delivered unto them firſt of all, that which he alſo received, How that Chriſt died for their ſins, according to the Scriptures; and that he was buried; and that he roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Cor. 15. 1, 2, 3, 4. with Chap. 6. 9, 10, 11. and Chap. 12. 2. Yea, <hi>the love of Chriſt,</hi> in dying for All, and riſing again, known and believed by his Ambaſſadors, <hi>did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them to perſwade men;</hi> and where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came, thus to <hi>pray in Chriſts ſtead, Be ye reconciled unto God:</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 11-14, 15-19, 20, 21. and Chap. 6. 1, 2. And this is one evident and fundamental
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:185024:43"/>
Demonſtration of the truth of what God here ſwears; to wit, <hi>That he hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked.</hi> Chriſt is the <hi>Amen, the faithful and true Witneſs</hi> hereof: <hi>Rev.</hi> 1. 5. and Chap. 3. 14. And as God's commanding <hi>Moſes to ſet a Serpent of braſs upon a Pole, that thoſe who were ſtung with the fiery Serpents,</hi> for their deſpiſing the <hi>Manna, might look unto it, and live:</hi> Did plainly evince, that it was not his Mind or Will, <hi>that they ſhould die of their ſtings:</hi> Num. 21. Even ſo, God hath herein more brightly ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted, <hi>That he is not willing that any ſhould periſh;</hi> In that <hi>the Son of Man hath been lifted up</hi> from the Earth for them; and <hi>lifted up from the gates of death,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>For ſo God loved the World, that he gave his onely begotten Son:</hi> John 3. 14, 15, 16, 17.</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is further evident, <hi>That God hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked,</hi> in this; In that Chriſt by his Death, in the vertue whereof he is raiſed again, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>the Deliverer from the wrath to come:</hi> 1 Theſ. 1. 10. for thereby he hath obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the forgiveneſs of thoſe ſins which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, and bring men under the ſentence of Condemnation to the wrath to come:
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:185024:43"/>
               <hi>Luke</hi> 2. 30, 31. He who deſcended into the lower parts of the Earth; and <hi>who is aſcended up on high, and hath led captivity captive; hath received gifts in the man, even for the rebellious alſo; that the Lord God might dwell</hi> among them: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. <hi>without blood ſhedding there is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſins;</hi> to wit, without the Blood-ſhedding of the Son of God<hi>: For it was not poſſible that the blood of Goats and Calves ſhould take away ſin. If Righteouſneſs could have come by the Law, then Chriſt died in vain:</hi> Heb 9. 22. and Chap. 10. 1-4, 5-9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. 21. And unleſs he who died for our ſins had been <hi>raiſed again for our juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> we muſt have remained neceſſarily <hi>in our ſins:</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 17. But now, he who bare our ſins in his own Body on the Tree, is raiſed again, <hi>and ſaw no corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:</hi> Therefore in him is prepared for ſinners, and in his Name preached to them, the forgiveneſs of thoſe ſins from which men could not be juſtified by the Law of <hi>Moſes:</hi> Acts 13. 32-37-39. <hi>He hath obtained eternal Redemption, even the forgiveneſs of our ſins by his blood, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the riches of Gods grace:</hi> Heb. 9. 12. with <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 7. forgiveneſs of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſins, and ſinners, while it is the Day
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:185024:44"/>
of Gods Grace and Patience<hi>:</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he ſaith to his Apoſtles, <hi>Thus it is written, and thus it behoved Chriſt to ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and to riſe again from the dead the third day: And that Repentance and For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins ſhould be preached in his Name, unto all Nations, beginning at</hi> Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem; <hi>which had killed the Prophets, and ſtoned them which were ſent unto them;</hi> And were afterwards <hi>the Betrayers and Murderers of the Lord of Glory:</hi> Luke 24. 46-48. with Chap. 13. 34. <hi>Acts</hi> 7. 53. Otherwiſe, indeed, I mean, If there were no Forgiveneſs of ſins with God in Chriſt for wicked Ones, he might be ſaid to have Pleaſure in their Death and Deſtruction<hi>:</hi> And the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael</hi> had rightly ſuppoſed what they did; as the Words may be read in the Verſe imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceding that which we are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering; to wit, <hi>O thou Son of Man, ſpeak unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>rightly, ye ſpeak, ſaying, If our iniquities and our ſins be upon us, and we pine away in them:</hi> (If there be no Attonement for them, no Forgiveneſs of them; ſee <hi>Num.</hi> 15. 30, 31. with <hi>verſe</hi> 27, 28, 29.) <hi>How ſhould we then live?</hi> Ezek. 33. 10. Or as the <hi>Pſamiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thou, LORD, ſhouldſt mark ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities,</hi>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:185024:44"/>
               <hi>O LORD, who ſhall ſtand? But there is forgiveneſs,</hi> (or as the <hi>Septuagint</hi> renders it, <hi>There is a propitiation) with thee, that thou mayſt be feared.</hi> And thence incourages the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding their great and manifold Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, yet to hope in his Mercy<hi>: Let Iſrael,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>hope in the LORD, for with the LORD is mercy, and with him is plenteous redemption:</hi> Pſal. 130. 3, 4-7. The Lord hath proclaimed himſelf to be <hi>gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and merciful, abundant in goodneſs—keeping mercy for thouſands, forgiving ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and tranſgreſſion, and ſin:</hi> Exod. 34. 6, 7. He hath a great Name for pardoning great iniquities; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25. 11. For <hi>he hath found out a Ranſom for our ſouls;</hi> an At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement for our ſins: <hi>Job</hi> 33. 24. <hi>He hath accepted a ſacrifice,</hi> even <hi>that</hi> of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>who,</hi> in the greatneſs of his love towards us, <hi>gave himſelf for us an Offering and a Sacrifice unto God, for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour:</hi> Eph. 5. 2. And <hi>in whom,</hi> by means thereof, <hi>we have redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption thorow his blood, even the forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> Col. 1. 14. As alſo, to the end we may be juſtified from, and receive the forgiveneſs of our ſins: <hi>God hath put his Spirit upon him, that he might bring forth</hi>
               <pb n="72" facs="tcp:185024:45"/>
               <hi>Judgment to us, and give Repentance to us</hi> from them; namely, That Grace and Power whereby we may Repent, <hi>that he may forgive our iniquity, and our ſin:</hi> as Jer. 36. 3. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, a Prince, and a Saviour, for to give Repentance</hi> to us alſo, <hi>and forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> Acts 5. 31. and Chap. 26. 18. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 42. 1. Luke 24. 46, 47, 48.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The truth of this alſo, <hi>That God hath no pleaſure in the Death of the wicked;</hi> fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther appears, and is evident hereby: In that he is vouchſafing Means of Grace unto them; and giving gracious Aid and Aſſiſtance in and with the Means, to the end, that the wicked may Repent, and turn from their evil ways, that iniquity may not be their ruine: He doth not onely call them to Repentance with an outward Call; but he alſo <hi>ſtretcheth forth his hand,</hi> his Power and Spirit with his Calls, <hi>that</hi> ſuch may <hi>turn at his Reproofs:</hi> Prov. 1. 21, 22-24. Our Lord Jeſus is <hi>the true light, that lighteth every man that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the world:</hi> John 1. 9. <hi>He is the light of the world, which lieth in wickedneſs;</hi> or, in the wicked One<hi>: Joh.</hi> 8. 12. with 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 19. <hi>To open the eyes of the blind, and to bring forth the priſoners out of priſon, and</hi>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:185024:45"/>
               <hi>them that fit in darkneſs out of the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe:</hi> Iſa. 42. 6, 7. <hi>To open the eyes of Jews and Gentiles. and to turn them from dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God; that they may receive forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſins, and inheritance among them that are ſanctified through faith in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Acts 26. 17. 18. And he is therefore <hi>the Light</hi> unto the Gentiles alſo, the light of the World, <hi>that he might be for ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> unto All, even <hi>unto the ends of the earth;</hi> that through him they might be ſaved<hi>: Iſa.</hi> 49. 6. with <hi>Acts.</hi> 13. 47. And as it is the nature and property of the Light to manifeſt and diſcover all things unto men in their true and proper co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours; <hi>For whatſoever doth make manifeſt, is light: Epheſ.</hi> 5. 13. So our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, doth in and by his Teſtimony and Teſtimonis of his Goodneſs, manifeſt himſelf, and Gods Grace in himſelf, to the Sons of Men; <hi>He makes himſelf ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt unto them that asked not after him. And as</hi> in former times, <hi>Moſes lifted up the Serpent in the wilderneſs,</hi> that the ſtung <hi>Iſraelites</hi> might look unto, and behold it, and live; <hi>Even ſo the Son of Man is lifted up</hi> by the Spirit in the Goſpel, that ſinners may look unto and believe in
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:185024:46"/>
him<hi>:</hi> And, <hi>that whoſoever believeth in him might not periſh, but have everlaſting life:</hi> Rom. 10. 18-20. <hi>John</hi> 3. 14-16. Hence he who is a juſt God and a Saviour, and there is none beſides him, calleth unto men, and ſaith, <hi>Look unto me all the ends of the earth, and be ye ſaved; for I am God, and there is none elſe:</hi> Iſa. 45. 2-1, 22, 23. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2. 8, 9, 10. And Chriſt, as the Light, doth alſo manifeſt the odiouſneſs and vileneſs of our ſins; and what an evil and bitter thing it is to forſake the Lord, and that his fear is not in men: as <hi>Jer.</hi> 2. 19. And the neceſſity of their being turned there-from, without which they muſt all neceſſarily periſh; as after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards we may ſhew more largely: <hi>All things that are reproved, are made mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt by the Light;—wherefore he ſaith, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wake thou that ſleepeſt, and ariſe from the dead, and Chriſt ſhall give thee light:</hi> Eph. 5. 13, 14. And this moſt Excellent One, doth alſo, as is before ſaid; Open the blind Eyes of the Souls of Men, to ſee what he is manifeſting to them: <hi>God hath given him for a light of the Gentiles, to open the blind eyes,</hi> &amp;c. Iſa. 42. 6, 7. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he excels the Light of this World, for though <hi>that</hi> doth manifeſt the things
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:185024:46"/>
here below, yet it will not give Sight un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to thoſe that are blind, to behold what it doth manifeſt and diſcover; it will not open the eyes of thoſe that want their bodily ſight. But now, our Lord Jeſus is <hi>the true light,</hi> the moſt excellent light, who gives both <hi>light</hi> and <hi>ſight: he lightens every man that cometh into the world:</hi> John 1. 6-9. And not only ſo, but he gives grace unto all, even that Aid and Aſſiſtance, whereby they may turn from their evil and pernicious ways, and live. <hi>The grace of God brings ſalvation,</hi> or <hi>is ſaving unto all men:</hi> Tit. 2. 11. <hi>The good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God leadeth men to repentance;</hi> even ſuch alſo as are not led by it, <hi>but after their own hardneſs and impenitent hearts, treaſure up to themſelves wrath againſt the day of wrath, and revelation of the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judgment of God:</hi> Rom. 2. 4, 5. It is true indeed, <hi>No man can</hi> turn from his iniquities, and <hi>come unto Jeſus Chriſt, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs it be given unto him of the Father; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he draw him:</hi> John 6. 44, 45. But it is as true alſo, that God in due time <hi>doth draw all men</hi> by Jeſus Chriſt, even ſuch alſo <hi>as refuſe to return:</hi> Hoſ 11. 4, 5. with <hi>John</hi> 12. 31, 32. Though <hi>the Spirit that dwells in us</hi> (naturally) <hi>luſteth to envy;</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:185024:47"/>
               <hi>yet he giveth more grace;</hi> That we might not follow after our own Spirit: Jam. 4. 5, 6. As <hi>Chriſt is exalted with Gods right hand a Prince and Saviour, to give repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> &amp;c. So he is faithful in giving it in due ſeaſon. And there is good reaſon for us to believe he is ſo; foraſmuch as <hi>he was faithful to him that appointed him,</hi> in that difficult work of <hi>humbling himſelf, and becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the Croſs:</hi> Acts. 5. 30, 31. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 1, 2. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50. 5-8-10. Doutbleſs God doth not onely afford outward Means, and calls wicked Ones with an outward Call to Repentance<hi>:</hi> But he is diſpenſing to them his Grace and Spirit, to enable them to turn from their Iniquities, and to exerciſe themſelves to Godlineſs; e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecially he doth ſo to us, who have the Name of Chriſt called upon us, and the Goſpel and Scriptures continued with us: (And to none other can I ſpeak.) And to ſignifie to us, that the holy Spirit doth accompany the Goſpel, to work in men both to will and to do, of good pleaſure, what God requires of them: Therefore is the Goſpel called, <hi>the miniſtration of the Spirit:</hi> Yea it is called, <hi>the Spirit:</hi> 2 Cor. 3. 6-8. And the words which Chriſt
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:185024:47"/>
ſpake unto them that did not believe, are ſaid to be <hi>Spirit and Life:</hi> John 6. 63, 64. And when our Lord enlarges the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of his Apoſtles, and commands them to <hi>go into all the World, and preach the Goſpel to every Creature;</hi> to wit, of all the Nations: This is that then which he promiſes to them, and aſſures them of; that he would go along, and work with them; to wit, by his Spirit: <hi>Lo,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I am with you always, even unto the end of the world.</hi> And to aſſure us that he was as good as his word unto his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles; it is therefore alſo ſaid, <hi>They went forth, and preached every where, the Lord working with them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 18, 19, 20. with <hi>Mark</hi> 16. 15-20. <hi>He there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that rejecteth, rejecteth not man, but God, who hath alſo given his holy Spirit,</hi> unto the Miniſters of his Word, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them<hi>:</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4. 8. And this al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo ſhews, <hi>he hath no pleaſure,</hi> none at all, <hi>in the death of the wicked,</hi> while it is called to Day. But to this particular, I ſhall not here further enlarge, becauſe we ſhall have apt Occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat further unto this and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer particulars, in what followeth.</p>

4. That he is not willing that wicked Ones ſhould periſh, appears alſo, and is evident hereby; In that our <hi>Lord Jeſus Chriſt doth,</hi> by the will of God, <hi>make In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for Tranſgreſſors:</hi> Iſa. 53. 12. <hi>to ſpeak good for them, and to turn away Gods wrath from them:</hi> (as <hi>Jer.</hi> 18. 20. with Chap. 27. 18.) He is the Propitiation for their ſins, who through Grace believe; <hi>and not for their ſins onely, but alſo for the ſins of the whole world:</hi> 1 John 2. 2. <hi>The Lamb of God, that taketh away the ſin of the World:</hi> That Judgment may not ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be executed upon it: <hi>John</hi> 1. 29. And hereby the Apoſtle doth prove and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate, <hi>That God will have all men to be ſaved:</hi> (And therefore <hi>hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked;)</hi> Becauſe there is <hi>One Mediator between God and Men, the Man Chriſt Jeſus, who gave himſelf a Ranſom for all:</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4, 5, 6. And while he In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercedes for Sinners and Tranſgreſſors, God hears him<hi>:</hi> And, <hi>Behold, now is the accepted time: behold, now is the Day of Salvation:</hi> 2 Cor. 6. 1, 2. He doth by his powerful Interceſſion prevail as a Prince with God his Father, that further Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience and Forbearance might be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed toward ſuch as deſerve to be cut
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:185024:48"/>
off in their Treſpaſſes. And this is an Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that God is not willing that any ſhould periſh, but that all ſhould come to Repentance; <hi>Becauſe he is long-ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them.</hi> And the Apoſtle exhorts the Believers; to <hi>Account,</hi> or <hi>Reckon,</hi> that <hi>the long-ſuffering of our Lord is ſalvation:</hi> To wit, toward them to whom it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exerciſed. Their accounting his long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Salvation, doth not make it ſo to be<hi>:</hi> But his Long-ſuffering being Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, gives them good ground ſo to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it; for his Long-ſuffering is a Fruit of his Love and Charity toward them to whom it is vouchſafed<hi>:</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9. 15. with 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. 4. while God waits, <hi>he waits that he may be gracious,</hi> even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Rebellious Ones alſo<hi>: Iſa.</hi> 30. 8-18. <hi>that they might be brought unto God:</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. 20. As it is ſaid concerning Gods profeſſed People in former times, many whereof were diſobedient and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious: <hi>Yea many years didſt thou forbear them,—that thou mighteſt bring them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to thy Law:</hi> Neh. 9. 29, 30. And hence alſo, when the Lord is ſaid to be Long-ſuffering, or ſlow to Anger, then very frequently, he is affirmed to be <hi>merciful and gracious, or of great kindneſs.</hi> To ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:185024:49"/>
to us, That his Long-ſuffering is an Evidence and Expreſſion of his Mercy, Grace, and kindneſs towards the Sons of Men<hi>: Exod.</hi> 34. 6. <hi>Num.</hi> 14. 18. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 17. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 86. 15. and 145. 8. <hi>Joel</hi> 2. 13. <hi>Jona.</hi> 4. 2. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But againſt what we are now conſidering, ſome may object, and ſay, <hi>Chriſt would not vouchſafe to pray for the World; And then to be ſure he did not die for it: Nor is it the Will of God that the World ſhould be ſaved; but he hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their deſtruction:</hi> John 17. 9.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> This ſaying of our Saviour's is much abuſed and wreſted by many, who are Enemies to the Grace of God in Chriſt to Mankind; And his words are altered, to make them ſerve their evil Deſign<hi>:</hi> For,</p>
            <p>1. Our Saviour doth not ſay, <hi>He would not pray for the World;</hi> or, <hi>that he never did, or will pray for it:</hi> But his words are, <hi>I pray not,</hi> (to wit, at that preſent time) <hi>for the World,</hi> &amp;c. Now that doth not at all deny that he might pray for the World at another time<hi>:</hi> As may appear in other ſayings of like nature. As where our Saviour ſaith concerning his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, <hi>I ſpeak not of you all:</hi> John 13. 18.
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:185024:49"/>
It would be very falſe from hence to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, That he would not, nor never did ſpeak of them <hi>all:</hi> for other-where it is very evident he did ſo: <hi>Matth.</hi> 10. 1. <hi>John</hi> 6. 67. So alſo he thus ſpeaks in another place concerning his faithful Diſciples; <hi>I do not ſay, that I will pray the Father for you:</hi> John 16. 26. Now, would not thoſe men who ſo pervert <hi>John</hi> 17. 9. exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly blame any that ſhould infer here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>from, and ſay, <hi>Our Saviour never ſaid, he would pray for his own Diſciples;</hi> Becauſe he there ſaith, <hi>I do not ſay, that I will pray the Father for you?</hi> And indeed, ſuch an Inference would be moſt untrue, and exceedingly condemnable<hi>:</hi> for though he did not there ſay, he would pray the Father for them, yet elſe-where he doth ſo ſay; for in <hi>John</hi> 14. 16. he thus aſſures them, <hi>I will pray the Father for you,</hi> &amp;c. And the ſame we may apply to this Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture objected, as will further appear by and by.</p>
            <p>2. There is this good Reaſon why the World ſhould then be excluded from his Prayer in that place, becauſe he is put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up Requeſts to his Father for the then Actual Believers, and which were onely proper to be petitioned for them,
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:185024:50"/>
and not for the World, while in that ſtate: to wit, <hi>That they might be kept in Gods Name: that they might be one; that they might be ſanctified through the truth: and ſent into the World as Chriſt was;</hi> to wit, <hi>to preach the Goſpel,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>John</hi> 17. 9-19. Now, how could our <hi>Saviour pray for the World,</hi> while of the World, in theſe Petitions, which were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to be preſented for them? Could he pray, <hi>That they might be kept in Gods Name,</hi> that were not in it? Or, <hi>that they might be one,</hi> in their evil Ways and Deſigns? Or, <hi>that they might be ſent into the World to preach the Goſpel,</hi> who did not believe the Goſpel? No ſurely. But this doth no more deny that our Saviour ever prayed for the World, than <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi>'s praying for his Son <hi>Iſhmael,</hi> or <hi>Iſaac,</hi> denies he ever prayed for <hi>Sodom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> That is to ſay, not in the leaſt; for at ſeveral times, and in divers Petitions he prayed both for the former and the latter.</p>
            <p>3. Nay, it evidently appears in <hi>Joh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> 17. That <hi>our Saviour prayed for the world<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> though not in <hi>verſe</hi> 9-19. Or, the good of the World was one great thing aimed at, and deſigned, in his praying for them
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:185024:50" rendition="simple:additions"/>
who were choſen out of the World: for that Prayer may be divided into four Parts. Firſt, <hi>Our Saviour prays for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf;</hi> and therein prays not for the World, nor for the Believers directly: <hi>John</hi> 17. 1-5. then <hi>he prays for ſuch as were then actual Believers;</hi> having an eſpecial and moſt full Aim therein at his Apoſtles, and not for the World; nor directly, and fully for ſuch as ſhould after believe, <hi>verſe</hi> 6-19. Nextly, he prays for future Believers, even <hi>for all ſuch as ſhould,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that time, <hi>believe on him thorow the Apoſtles word,</hi> verſe 20, 21, 22, 23, 24. And laſtly, The end of his Prayer for the Apoſtles and other Believers, was, for the good of the World. As it is ſaid, <hi>That all may be one, as thou Father art in me, and I in thee, that they alſo may be one in us: [That the World may believe that thou didſt ſend me.]</hi> Which was <hi>that</hi> the Believers did believe; and in the belief whereof they were rendred and accounted true Believers: <hi>John</hi> 17. 8. And again, <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be made perfect in one: [And that the World may know that thou haſt ſent me, and haſt loved them.)</hi> to wit, the ſincere Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers) <hi>as thou haſt loved me:]</hi> John 17.
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:185024:51"/>
21-23. Like that, <hi>God be merciful unto us, and bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

So that this <hi>Objection</hi> is wholly groundleſs, falſe, and of no force againſt what hath been ſaid.</p>
            <p>5. It is alſo hereby evidenced, <hi>That God hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> In that he ſends his Servants to them <hi>to testifie againſt them,</hi> and to warn them of their ſins, and of the danger they expoſe themſelves unto thereby. As it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord God of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſent to them by the hand of his Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers, riſing up betimes, and ſending: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he had compaſſion on his people:</hi> 2 Chron. 36. 15. And in this <hi>Ezek</hi> 33. The Lord ſaith, <hi>Son of Man, I have ſet thee a Watch man unto the Houſe of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>therefore thou ſhalt hear the word at my mouth, and warn them from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, O wicked man, thou ſhalt ſurely die: If thou doeſt not ſpeak to warn the wicked from his way, that wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand: Nevertheleſs if thou warn the wicked of his way, to turn</hi>
               <pb n="85" facs="tcp:185024:51"/>
               <hi>from it: If he do not turn from his way, he ſhall die in his iniquity; but thou haſt deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered thy Soul:</hi> verſe 1-9. whereto he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently adds in the next <hi>verſe</hi> but one, <hi>I live, ſaith the Lord Ged, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked;</hi> verſe 11. To give us to underſtand, That his ſending his Servants, <hi>to warn the wicked of their evil ways,</hi> is an Evidence, <hi>that he delights not in their deſtruction:</hi> But that they might take warning &amp; live. See alſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 3. 17-21. So that good man ſaith, <hi>Thou teſtifiedſt againſt them,</hi> who were diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient and rebellious; <hi>that thou mighteſt bring them again to thy Law:</hi> Neh. 9. 26-29. And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>We preach Chriſt, warning every man, and teaching every man in all wiſdom, that we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent every man perfect in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Col. 1. 28. And when he thus ſends his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants to warn the wicked, he doth not ſend them alone, but accompanies them with the Light and Influence of his bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Spirit. Thus it is ſaid, <hi>Many years didſt thou forbear them, and</hi> (all this while) <hi>testifiedſt againſt them by thy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in the hand of thy Prophets,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 29, 30. And the Prophet <hi>Micah</hi> ſaith, <hi>Truly, I am full of power by the Spirit of the</hi>
               <pb n="86" facs="tcp:185024:52"/>
               <hi>Lord, and of judgment, and of might, to declare unto</hi> Jacob <hi>his tranſgreſſion, and to the Houſe</hi> of Iſrael <hi>his ſin:</hi> Micah 3. 8. with Chap. 2. 7. Zech. 7. 12. 1 Theſ. 4. 1-8. Acts 7. 51. When the Lord is ſo highly provoked againſt any, as to caſt them off, then he threatens; <hi>He will come on them as a thief, and they ſhall not know what hour he will come upon them.</hi> He will then forbear to give them warning; but when they are ſecure, <hi>when they ſay, peace and ſafety, then ſudden deſtruction comes upon them, as travail upon a woman with child, and they ſhall not eſcape:</hi> Rev. 3. 3. 1 Theſ. 5. 2, 3. But while he doth admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and fore-warn them of their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ways, and cries unto them, <hi>O do not this abominable thing that I hate:</hi> And ſhews unto them, That their continuing in the paths of darkneſs will be bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the end; he doth evidence, that he is not willing with their Perdition, but would that they ſhould conſider their ways and doings, and turn there-from unto him, who is ready to pardon them, and receive them to his mercy: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50. 17-21. He doth fore-warn them, that they might turn from their wicked ways, <hi>and ſo flee from the wrath to come:</hi> as Mat. 3. 7. 8. <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="tcp:185024:52"/>
6. That the Lord God hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the eternal Deſtruction of the Wicked, while they are joyned to all the living, appears, by his Expoſtulations and Pleadings with them<hi>:</hi> As, <hi>What iniquity have your Fathers found in me, that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are become vain?</hi> Jer. 2. 5-8. <hi>Have I been a wilderneſs unto</hi> Iſrael? <hi>a land of darkneſs? Wherefore ſay my people, We have dominion, we will come no more unto thee?</hi> Verſe 29-31. <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, for why will ye die, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael? E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 33. 11. <hi>O</hi> Ephraim, <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? O</hi> Judah, <hi>what ſhall I do unto thee? for your goodneſs is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away:</hi> Hoſ. 6. 3-7. Jer 9. 7. <hi>O thou that art named the Houſe of</hi> Jacob, <hi>is the Spirit of the Lord ſtraitned? are theſe his doings?</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cah 2. 7. <hi>O my people, what have I done unto thee? and wherewith have I wearied thee? testifie againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. Micah 6. 2-5. Surely he doth not thus ſpeak, to inſult over them in their miſery, or while he ſecretly delights in their eternal ruine: But to ſignifie, he is not pleaſed they ſhould periſh. As he ſaith, <hi>Why will ye die, O Houſe of</hi> Iſrael? <hi>For I have no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi>
               <pb n="88" facs="tcp:185024:53"/>
               <hi>in the death of him that dieth, ſaith the Lord God? wherefore turn and live ye:</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zek. 18. 30, 31, 32. The truth hereof is alſo further manifeſted, by his patheti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and breathing Votes and Deſires con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them: As, <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in them, that they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always, that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever!</hi> Deut. 5. 29. <hi>O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end!</hi> Deut. 32. 28, 29. <hi>O that my people had hearkened unto me,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael had walked in my ways:</hi> Pſal. 81. 13, 14. <hi>O that thou hadſt hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unto my Commandments! then had thy peace been as a river, and thy righteouſneſs as the waves of the ſea:</hi> Iſa. 48. 17, 18. <hi>Wilt thou not be made clean? when ſhall it once be?</hi> Jer 13. 27. <hi>If,</hi> or, <hi>O that thou hadst known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day, the things which belong to thy peace:</hi> Luke 19. 42. As alſo the truth of what the Lord ſwears to, appears in that he ſpeaks as one grieved at the very heart, that men have turned a deaf ear to him, and ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered their ways unto ſtrangers, and obeyed not his Voice. As it is ſaid by himſelf, <hi>Forty years longer was I grieved</hi>
               <pb n="89" facs="tcp:185024:53"/>
               <hi>with this generation, and ſaid, it is a people that do err in their hearts, and they have not known my ways:</hi> Pſal. 95. 10. So he ſpeaks as one grieved in Spirit, and ſaith, <hi>My people would not hearken to my voice, and</hi> Iſrael <hi>would none of me:</hi> Pſal. 81. 8-11. And of our Lord Jeſus, who is the Image of the Inviſible God; it is ſaid, <hi>When he beheld the City, he wept over it, ſaying, If thou hadſt known, even thou,</hi> &amp;c. Luke 19. 41, 42. John 13. 21. The truth hereof alſo is evidenced, In his ſlowneſs to Anger, and loathneſs to give them up, who refuſed to return unto him, but were Idolaters, and bent to back-ſliding from the Lord. As, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up,</hi> Ephraim? <hi>how ſhall I delivar thee,</hi> Iſrael? <hi>how ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah? <hi>how ſhall I ſet thee as</hi> Seboim? <hi>Mine heart is turned within me, my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings are kindled together. I will not execute the fierceneſs of mine anger; I will not return to deſtroy</hi> Ephraim, <hi>for I am God, and not man; the holy One in the midſt of thee: And I will not enter into the City:</hi> Hoſ. 11. 2-8, 9. Mal. 3. 6. And laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, As to this particular, That <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked,</hi> is evident, and evidenced in his Readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:185024:54"/>
to Repent him of the Evil threatned by him, and juſtly deſerved by them, upon their turning to him: And readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to receive unto his Mercy great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, though their wickedneſs hath been very great, and long continued in<hi>:</hi> Though their wickedneſs hath been like unto <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> and though their ſins have been as Scarlet, and red like Crimſon; yea though they have ſpoken and done evil things as they could<hi>:</hi> As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 1. 10-18. Jer. 3. 15. So the Lord ſaith, <hi>Turn unto the Lord your God:</hi> And to move them ſo to do, he adds, <hi>For he is gracious and merciful, ſlow to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteth him of the evil:</hi> Joel 2. 12, 13. Thus he dealt with <hi>Nineveh, when he ſaw their works, that they turned from their evil way, God repented him of the evil that he ſaid he would do unto them, and he did it not. But it diſpleaſed</hi> Jonah <hi>exceedingly, and he was very angry,—and ſaid, I pray thee, O Lord, was not this my ſaying when I was yet in my Country? Therefore I fled before unto</hi> Tarſhiſh; <hi>for I knew that thou art a gracious God, and merciful, ſlow to anger, and of great kindneſs, and repenteſt thee of the evil:</hi> Jonah 3. 8-10. and 4. 1. 2.
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:185024:54" rendition="simple:additions"/>
So when <hi>Ephraim</hi> repented, and ſmote upon the thigh; the Lord ſaith, <hi>Is</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim <hi>my dear ſon? Is he a pleaſant child? for ſince I ſpake against him, I do earnestly remember him ſtill, therefore my bowels are troubled for him: I will ſurely have mercy upon him, ſaith the Lord;</hi> Jer. 31. 18-20. How ready and forward was the Father in the Parable to be reconciled unto, and with joy to receive and give entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment unto his prodigal Son, when through his neceſſity and indigency he though of returning, and began ſo to do? <hi>When he was yet a great way off, his Father ſaw him, and had compaſſion, and fell on his neck and kiſſed him,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And I ſay unto you,</hi> ſaith our Saviour, <hi>That joy ſhall be in Heaven over one ſinner that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penteth, more than over ninety and nine juſt perſons, which need no repentance:</hi> Luke 15. 2-7-12-32.</p>
            <p>Nay, when ſome ſuch have not turned to him with the whole heart, but feign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly, how ready hath he been to ſpare them? As it is ſaid, <hi>Nevertheleſs they did flatter him with their mouths, and they lied unto him with their tongues: for their heart was not right with him, neither were they ſtedfaſt in his Covenant: But he being full</hi>
               <pb n="92" facs="tcp:185024:55"/>
               <hi>of compaſſion forgave their iniquity, and deſtroyed them not. Yea many a time turned he his anger away, and did not ſtir up all his wrath. And the long-ſuffering of our Lord is ſalvation:</hi> Pſalm 78. 34-36-38. 1 King. 21. 27-29.</p>
            <p>Now all theſe things conſidered, and put together, do clearly evince and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to us, <hi>That the Lord hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the death of him that dieth.</hi> How can it once enter into our hearts, or be entertained by us, That he who ſo expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulates with wicked Ones, and ſaith, <hi>Why will ye die?</hi> That ſo pathetically de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires deſires their good; that is ſo grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at the heart <hi>for the hardneſs of their hearts:</hi> as <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 5. That is ſo loath to give up ſuch as have highly provoked him to anger<hi>:</hi> That is ſo ready to repent him of the evil; and to receive with joy and gladneſs ſuch as repent and turn unto him from their Iniquities; and to ſpare them who feignedly turn unto him; that they might conſider their ways, and turn their feet unto his Teſtimonies: That he mean time doth ſecretly delight in, and deſire their Eternal Ruine<hi>!</hi> O my Soul, come not thou into the Secret of them who ſuffer ſuch wicked thoughts
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:185024:55"/>
of God to lodge within them<hi>:</hi> Unto their Aſſembly mine Honour be not thou united: as <hi>Gen.</hi> 49. 5, 6.</p>
            <p>7. As alſo it appears, <hi>That the Lord hath no pleaſure in the Eternal Ruine of the Wicked,</hi> while it is the Day of his Grace and Patience: Becauſe he doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in ſeverely correcting here in this World. <hi>He doth not willingly,</hi> or <hi>from the heart afflict, or grieve the children of men. To cruſh under his feet all the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of the earth,—the Lord approveth it not:</hi> Or, feeth it not; to wit, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light<hi>: Lam.</hi> 3. 33-36. He doth indeed afflict, and execute judgments in the Earth on thoſe who contemn his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels<hi>:</hi> But he doth not take Pleaſure therein; nor doth he puniſh them but when their need requires it<hi>:</hi> for he is ſlow to anger; and his Soul is grieved for their miſery who have greatly ſinned againſt him<hi>: Judg.</hi> 10. 16. It is not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to him now to plead with wicked Ones in his furious Rebukes. Hence it is ſaid, <hi>The Lord ſhall riſe up as in Mount</hi> Perazim, <hi>he ſhall be wroth as in the Valley of</hi> Gibeon<hi>: that he may do his work, his ſtrange work;</hi> (ſo called, becauſe it is an unpleaſant work to him: As <hi>Job</hi>'s

               <hi>breath</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>ſtrange,</hi> unpleaſant, &amp; undelightful, <hi>to his Wife:</hi> Job 19. 13-17.) <hi>And bring to paſs his Act, his ſtrange Act:</hi> Iſa. 28. 21. And therefore he doth not bring to paſs his <hi>ſtrange Act,</hi> till there be a neceſſity for it, as it were<hi>:</hi> And all more gracious and favourable means and methods have proved unſucceſsful and ineffectual: Hence the Lord ſaith, I will melt them, and try them, (to wit, throw them into the <hi>Furnace of affliction:</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 48. 10.) <hi>For how ſhall I do for the daughter of my people?</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, What other courſe can I take for the reclaiming them from their evil ways? All thoſe more-mild means he had been making uſe of, had proved in vain toward them; and therefore he would thus proceed againſt them, in do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ſtrange and undelightful work amongſt them: <hi>Jer.</hi> 9. 7. Unto Acts of Mercy and Grace he is very forward, and exerciſes himſelf therein prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly without and before mens deſires: And notwithſtanding their demerits, <hi>He giveth liberally to all men, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not:</hi> John 3. 16, 17. 2 Cor. 1. 3. Jam. 1. 5. But unto Acts of ſeverity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards wicked Ones he is very back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,
<pb n="95" facs="tcp:185024:56"/>
while it is to Day. And ſome of his holy Servants have ſeemed to think him too backward and unready thereto; and therefore have they earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated Judgments upon great Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, before he hath executed them: <hi>Jer.</hi> 11. 20-23. and Chap. 18. 20-23. And thus pleaded with him, <hi>Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look upon Iniquity,</hi> or Grievance: <hi>Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and holdeſt thy tongue when the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed devoureth the man that is more righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than he? And makeſt men as the fiſhes of the ſea,</hi> &amp;c. Ha. 1. 2-4. 13-17. <hi>Pſ.</hi> 35. 17. Yea when that eminent Prophet <hi>Elijah made interceſſion to God againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, They have killed thy Prophets, and digged down thine Altars,</hi> &amp;c. So gracious was the Lord, and ſo ſlow to anger, that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts againſt the Prophets Charge, and, as it were pleads for them<hi>: Rom.</hi> 11. 2, 3, 4.</p>
            <p>Now then, to Argue from the Leſs to the Greater, and from the Shorter to that which is Perpetual<hi>:</hi> If God had no Pleaſure to inflict tolerable and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paravely light Afflictions upon evil men; ſurely then much rather we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:185024:57"/>
and conclude, That he doth not delight in laying upon them ſuch Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Torments as are even intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable, and unſupportable. And again, if it be not pleaſing to him that Sinners and evil Doers ſhould be ſeverely afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this life with momentany and ſhort Afflictions; much more unwilling is he that they ſhould <hi>go into that everlasting fire, prepared for the Devil and his Angels;</hi> and therein <hi>he deſtroyed wth everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the Glory of his power.</hi> And doth not the Lord himſelf lead us thus to Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon? for the holy Spirit directs the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets thus to Aſſert, and ſay, <hi>The Lord will not caſt off for ever: But though he cauſe grief, he will have compaſſion accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the multitude of his mercies.</hi> But what doth he bring to prove and evince, that he <hi>will not cast off for ever?</hi> It pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently follows, <hi>For he doth not willingly afflict,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>He who now doth not from his heart,</hi> or with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>afflict for a moment, is more unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to caſt off to all eternity:</hi> Lam. 3. 31, 32, 33. <hi>Thou ſhalt conſider in thy heart,</hi> ſaith Moſes, <hi>that as a man chasteneth his Son, the Lord thy God chaſteneth thee:</hi> Deut.
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:185024:57"/>
8. 5. Now, how doth a tender-hearted Parent chaſten his froward and ſtubborn Son? Surely with a great deal of loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and reluctancy<hi>:</hi> It is not the Work of his Delight ſo to do. Even ſo our Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Father, (who is ſo pitiful and of ſuch tender mercies, that the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently indulgent Parent here, is but evil, in compariſon of him; as our Saviour gives us to underſtand<hi>: Matth.</hi> 7. 11.) doth not delight to afflict his Sons and Daughters, (as all men are by Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Redemption: <hi>Mal.</hi> 2. 10. <hi>Deut.</hi> 32. 6. 19.) when they provoke him to anger, but is very ſlow and backward thereto. And as we may be confident, and ſafely conclude, that no tender-hearted Parent, who hath no Pleaſure to whip his Son, hath much leſs any Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to kill him, and to bereave himſelf of him for ever. So likewiſe we may more confidently perſwade our ſelves, That the God and Father of all, who now <hi>chaſtens not</hi> Sinners <hi>for his Pleaſure;</hi> hath much more no Pleaſure to caſt them into Hell-fire, <hi>where their worm di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and their fire is not quenched:</hi> Heb. 12. 10. And they that will entertain and hold faſt ſuch thoughts of God as theſe,
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:185024:58"/>
That though he doth not willingly afflict the Sons of Men, yet he hath a ſecret Delight or Pleaſure in their endleſs and eternal Ruine and Miſery; muſt turn their Reaſon out of the Doors of their Souls, that they may keep their unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable, groundleſs and abſurd Opinion in poſſeſſion. But the Apoſtle tells us, That <hi>ſuch as conſent not to wholſom words, even the words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt—they are fools, knowing nothing,</hi> (as they ought to know) <hi>but doting about Questions and ſtrifes of words, whereof cometh envy, ſtrife, railings, evil ſurmiſings,</hi> &amp;c. And he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore thus counſels, <hi>from ſuch with-draw thyſelf:</hi> 1 Tim. 6. 3, 4, 5.</p>
            <p>8. And laſtly, It alſo appears, and is hereby evidenced, <hi>That the Lord God hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked;</hi> By the Afflictions and Judgments which he now executes and infflicts upon them<hi>:</hi> for though <hi>he doth not willingly afflict,</hi> as hath been ſaid before; yet he doth afflict; <hi>Verily he is a God that judgeth in the earth: He forms the Light, and creates Darkneſs: He makes Peace, and creates Evil:</hi> To wit, Evil of Affliction and Judgment<hi>: Iſa.</hi> 45. 7. <hi>Amos.</hi> 3. 8. And this doth evince and evidence to us, That he hath no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:185024:58"/>
in their deſtruction, in that he makes uſe of ſuch Methods for their A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment as are ſtrange and grievous to him<hi>:</hi> which will yet further alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, if we duly conſider theſe two things: Namely,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Reaſon or Motive of his Afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Judging them<hi>:</hi> and that is, <hi>His love and merciful kindneſs</hi> towards them, towards their Immortal Souls. Indeed we are apt to look upon Afflictions as Tokens and Teſtimonies of his hatred towards us<hi>:</hi> But in ſo doing, we judge according to outward Appearance, and do not judge righteous Judgment<hi>:</hi> for his love moves him to correct us, when our need requires it; and ſo it doth to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the righteous. And his trying them is oppoſed to his hatred: <hi>Pſal.</hi> 11. 5. Hence the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>My Son, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe not thou the chaſtening of the Lord, nor faint when thou art rebuked of him; for whom the Lord loveth he chaſteneth, and ſcourgeth every Son whom he receiveth:</hi> Prov. 3. 11, 12. with Heb. 12. 5-7. Yea and it is out of love towards men gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, that he doth try them, and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them for their Faults and Follies. Hence <hi>Job</hi> breaks forth into Admiration,
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:185024:59"/>
and ſaith, <hi>What is man that thou ſhouldſt magnifie him! that thou ſhouldſt ſet thine heart upon him!</hi> (to wit, thy love and affection:) <hi>that thou ſhouldſt viſit him!</hi> (to wit, with Afflictions and Corrections: as <hi>Pſ.</hi> 89. 32.) <hi>every morning? and try him every moment?</hi> Job 7. 17-19. And when the Angel and Church of <hi>Laodicea</hi> were become <hi>luke-warm,</hi> and ſo loathſom and offenſive to Chriſt, as that he threatens <hi>to ſpue them out of his mouth:</hi> yet then he ſends this Meſſage to them, <hi>As many as I love, I rebuke and chaſten:</hi> Rev. 3. 15-19. And indeed, hereby alſo it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that while he is judging men in this World, he loves them: And that his Corrections proceed from his Love; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he ſignifies it to be a moſt high Expreſſion of ſevere Diſpleaſure, when he threatens to ceaſe, or forbear taking any longer ſuch pains with them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have been incorrigible under his Afflicting-hand. To this purpoſe he many times ſpeaks; as, <hi>Why ſhould ye<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be ſmitten any more?</hi> Iſa. 1. 5. <hi>I will not puniſh your Daughters when they commit Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, nor your Spouſes when they commit Adultery:</hi> Hoſ. 4. 14. Ephraim <hi>is joyned to Idols: let him alone,</hi> ver. 17. And that
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:185024:59"/>
he doth Correct and Chaſtiſe the Sons of Men, while it is called to Day, out of Love; and therefore is not willing with their Perdition; will yet further appear, if we conſider,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The end of the Lord in his Rebuking and Judging of them; yea of his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings and judgments; and that is, Their eternal good and welfare; that is the thing ultimately deſigned by him therein<hi>:</hi> As <hi>Elihu</hi> ſaith, <hi>Lo, all theſe things worketh God oftentimes with Man, to bring back his Soul from the Pit; to be enlightned with the light of the living. Mark well, O</hi> Job, <hi>ſaith</hi> Elihu, <hi>Hearken unto me,</hi> &amp;c. Job 33. 27-29-31.</p>
            <p>The end of the Lord in the liftings up of his hand, and threatnings, is, that men might ceaſe to do evil, and learn to do well; That he may repent him of the evil threatned to them, and be graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous unto them. <hi>At what inſtant,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>I ſhall ſpeak concerning a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and concerning a Kingdom, to pluck up, and to pull down, and to destroy. If that Nation againſt whom I have pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, turn from their evil,</hi> (which is the thing deſigned therein by him) <hi>I will repent of the evil that I thought to do unto</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:185024:60"/>
               <hi>them. Now therefore go to, ſpeak to the men of</hi> Judah, <hi>and to the Inhabitants of</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>ſaying, Thus ſaith the Lord, behold, I frame evil againſt you, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe a device againſt you: return you now every one from his evil way, and make your ways, and your doings good:</hi> Jer. 18. 7-11. And to the ſame purpoſe, the Lord com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands the ſame Prophet, <hi>To take a Roll of a Book,</hi> and write therein all the words that he had ſpoken unto him againſt <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael,</hi> and againſt <hi>Judah,</hi> &amp;c. And then adds, <hi>It may be that the Houſe of</hi> Judah <hi>will hear all the evil which I purpoſe to do unto them, that they may return every man from his evil way, that I may forgive their iniquity, and their ſin:</hi> Jer. 36. 2, 3. Ezek. 12. 2, 3. Jonah. 3. 4-9, 10. and Chap. 4. 1, 2. Pſal. 7. 12, 13.</p>
            <p>And ſo alſo his Deſign and end in exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting Jugments in the Earth, while it is called to Day, is, not the Deſtruction of Evil-doers, but the Correction and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendment of them<hi>: That when his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are in the earth, the Inhabitants of the world might learn righteouſneſs:</hi> Iſa. 26. 9. He therefore orders occaſions of ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and heavineſs to them, <hi>that by the ſadneſs of their countenances their hearts</hi>
               <pb n="103" facs="tcp:185024:60"/>
               <hi>might be made better:</hi> Eccl. 7. 2, 3. And therefore, <hi>he looketh upon men; and if any ſay, I have ſinned, and perverted that which was right, and it profited me not, he will deliver his Soul from going down into the pit, and his life ſhall ſee the light:</hi> Job 33. 27-30. <hi>When we are judged, we are chaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened of the Lord, that we ſhould not be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned with the world:</hi> 1 Cor. 11. 32. And that he doth aim at, and deſign the good of men, in his Correcting and Puniſhing them, appears from what hath been ſaid immediately before<hi>:</hi> Namely, That he doth chaſten them out of love<hi>: For love worketh no ill to another,</hi> but deſigns his good and benefit<hi>: Ro.</hi> 13. 9. And he that charges Parents not to with-hold Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from their Children,<hi>—but to beat them with the Rod, and ſo deliver their Souls from Hell:</hi> Doubtleſs, he intends the ſame in his Judgings of Men, while they are joyned to all the living<hi>: Prov.</hi> 23. 13, 14. with <hi>Job</hi> 33. 29, 30. and <hi>Pſal.</hi> 94. 10-12.</p>
            <p>And not onely is this his Gracious End in thoſe Chaſtiſements and Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which are more moderate and common to Man: But alſo in his more ſevere and furious Judgments and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes,
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:185024:61"/>
when he cauſes men <hi>to ſit in darkneſs, and in the ſhadow of Death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing bound in affliction and iron: Becauſe they rebelled againſt the words of God, and contemned the Counſel of the moſt High,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And whoſo is wiſe, and will obſerve theſe things, even they ſhall underſtand the loving-kindneſs of the Lord:</hi> Pſal. 107. 10-22-39-43. When <hi>none can ſtand before his indignation, and none can abide in the fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his anger: his fury being poured out like fire, and the rocks are thrown down by him.</hi> Yet then <hi>the Lord is good, a ſtrong hold in the day of trouble,</hi> &amp;c. Nah. 1. 2-6, 7. So the Apoſtle ſignifies, That the heavy and ſpiritual Judgments executed upon the unbelieving and diſobedient <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> according to thoſe Impreca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> againſt them, were not inflicted upon them for their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, but for the amendment of them, while it was the Day of Gods Grace to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them: <hi>According as it is written, God hath given them the Spirit of ſlumber,</hi> or remorſe, <hi>eyes that they ſhould not ſee, and ears that they ſhould not hear.</hi> And <hi>David</hi> ſaith, <hi>Let their table be made a ſnare, and a trap, and a ſtumbling-block, and a recompence unto them: Let their eyes be</hi>
               <pb n="105" facs="tcp:185024:61"/>
               <hi>darkned, that they may not ſee, and bow down their back alway.</hi> Theſe were moſt ſevere Judgments, in which God, in ſome meaſure, gave them up to a Reprobate Mind: And it might therefore be readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concluded by ſome, That God by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting theſe upon them, deſigned their Eternal Ruine<hi>:</hi> But the Apoſtle gives us cauſe otherwiſe to believe and judge; for he immediately ſubjoyns to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, <hi>I ſay then, have they not ſtumbled that they might fall? God forbid:</hi> (far be it from us ſo to conceive;) <hi>but through their fall ſalvation is come unto the</hi> Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles, <hi>for to provoke them</hi> (theſe Jews) <hi>to jealouſie:</hi> Rom. 11. 8, 9, 10, 11. And a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he ſaith, <hi>God hath concluded them all in unbelief;</hi> (taken away his Goſpel and Kingdom from them, and deprived them of thoſe choice and ſpiritual Priviledges and Advantages they were formerly fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured with;) <hi>that he might have mercy upon all:</hi> That he might have mercy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us <hi>Gentiles;</hi> for through their unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief and rejection, the Goſpel and its Priviledges were vouchſafed unto us; And that he might this way have mercy upon them alſo: <hi>That through our mercy, they might alſo obtain mercy.</hi> The Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:185024:62"/>
whereof cauſed the Apoſtle to break forth into Admiration, and ſay, <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out!</hi> Rom. 11. 30, 31, 32, 33, 34. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration whereof might preſerve us from being cenſorious, or raſhly judging any, when. God is inflicting his moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Judgments upon them<hi>: For who hath known the mind of the Lord? or who hath been his Counſellor?</hi> Verſe 34, 35. Yea he ſometimes gives up wicked Ones in his Church <hi>unto Satan, for the deſtruction of the fleſh, that they might learn not to blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheme: And that their Spirit might be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the day of the Lord:</hi> 1 Cor. 5. 4, 5-13. with 1 Tim. 1. 19, 20.</p>
            <p>And this is not onely his End in thoſe ſevere and diſmal Judgments, which he executes upon them that were in his Church, and of his people profeſſedly: But alſo as with reſpect to ſuch as were never joyned thereto, or of the number thereof. Hence the <hi>Pſalmist</hi> thus Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precates, as with reſpect to ſuch as were without the Pale of the Church: <hi>O my God, make them like a wheel, as the ſtubble before the wind: So perſecute them with</hi>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:185024:62"/>
               <hi>thy tempeſt, and make them afraid with thy ſtorm: Fill their faces with ſhame, that they may ſeek thy Name, O Lord. Let them be confounded and troubled for ever:</hi> (to wit, in their evil Deſigns and Enterprizes;) <hi>yea, let them be put to ſhame and periſh: That they may know that thou, whoſe Name alone is</hi> Jehovah, <hi>art the moſt High over all the Earth:</hi> Pſ. 83. 13-16-18. And here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by alſo it appears, That God is not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling that any ſhould periſh, in that he doth Afflict and Judge the Sons of Men, though not willingly, or delightfully ſo<hi>:</hi> And doth in all the Afflictions and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtiſements which he is inflicting on them, and chaſtening them withal, even in the greateſt and more ſevere alſo; Deſign their purging from their Iniquity, and Conformity to his Mind and Will<hi>:</hi> And ſo, their Eternal Good and Benefit. And as is alſo ſaid before, the two Particulars under this laſt-mentioned Head, do mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually evidence the truth of each other<hi>:</hi> That is to ſay, In that he Chaſtens and Corrects <hi>out of love;</hi> this ſhews, That his End in all his Rebukings is good towards men: And in that his Deſign and End is good and gracious towards Men, in his now Judgings of them; therein we may
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:185024:63"/>
ſee, that his Love towards them moves and prevails with him to make uſe of the Rod of Correction, <hi>that he might there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by purge out of the Hearts of the Children of Men that Folly that is bound up in them:</hi> 2 Chron. 33. 10, 11, 12, 13. Iſa. 9. 12, 13. <hi>His judgments are as the light that goeth forth: for he deſireth mercy and not ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, and the knowledge of God more than burnt-offerings:</hi> Hoſ. 5. 14, 15<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chap. 6. 1-5, 6. <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 6-9-12. Jer. 4. 13, 14. Pſal. 9. 19, 20.</p>
            <p n="3">3. But now having, I conceive, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently evidenced and demonſtrated the truth of what the Lord God here ſwears to; namely, <hi>That he hath no pleaſure,</hi> none at all, neither Revealed nor Secret, <hi>in the Death of the wicked;</hi> in the Eternal Deſtruction of him that dieth; accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Explication fore-given. I ſhall now, with the Aſſiſtance of the good Spirit of God, note and infer from what hath been ſaid, ſome Inſtructions that may be of uſefulneſs unto us. As to ſay.</p>
            <p n="1">1. If the <hi>Lord God hath no pleaſure in the Death,</hi> and Eternal miſery <hi>of the Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;</hi> Then we may be confident that he had no Pleaſure in the Death of the

Righteous; as all Men were as they were Created of God in the firſt Publick Man<hi>:</hi> And, <hi>before he did eat of the Tree of Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Good and Evil, whereof God com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded him he ſhould not eat:</hi> For All were then Innocent and Righteous. <hi>God created Man in his own Image, in the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of God created he him:</hi> To wit, <hi>In Knowledge, Righteouſneſs, and Holineſs of Truth:</hi> Gen. 1. 26, 27 with Eph. 4. 23, 24.

               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this Objection we may give ſeveral Anſwers, and ſay;</p>
            <p n="1">1. Suppoſe what is contained in this Objection were verily true, as it is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed very falſe and untrue: What ground of Comfort can they have concerning their own Children, who die in Infancy, that make this Objection, and believe it to be true? If they ſay, they are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves hearty Believers in Chriſt, and ſo <hi>Abraham</hi>'s Seed, and Heirs of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, and therefore their Children are in the Covenant: If all this ſhould be granted, yet may not as much at leaſt be, without any ſcruple affirmed of <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Father of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau;</hi> and yet they believe the one half of his Children was hated and reprobated before born: And why may it not be ſo with theirs al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo? See <hi>Gen.</hi> 26. 3, 4, 5. And me-thinks were this conſidered by them, it might fill their own hearts with continual ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row and heavineſs; unleſs this diſmal Decree of Reprobation, they plead for, hath made them perfectly like unto the <hi>Oſtrich, which is hardened againſt her young ones, as though they were not hers; her labour is in vain without fear: Becauſe God hath</hi>
               <pb n="116" facs="tcp:185024:67"/>
               <hi>deprived her of wiſdom, neither hath he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted to her understanding:</hi> Job 39. 13-17. But,</p>
            <p n="2">2. I further ſay, That there is nothing of truth at all in this Objection; and therefore it is like unto the reſt of their Tenets, in which they oppoſe the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Grace of God in Chriſt to all Mankind<hi>:</hi> For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is no reaſon to believe, <hi>That God hated</hi> Eſau <hi>before he was born;</hi> ſeeing God gave him to <hi>Iſaac,</hi> in anſwer to his Entreaty and Prayer: And ſo he might ſay, as his Son <hi>Jacob</hi> did afterwards con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Children; to wit, <hi>That he was one that God graciouſly gave unto him:</hi> Gen. 33. 5. For it is ſaid, <hi>Iſaac intreated the Lord for his Wife, becauſe ſhe was barren: And the Lord was intreated of him, and Rebekah his Wife conceived:</hi> Gen. 25. 21. Now what a Return of Prayer, and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to a like Prayer, was here, if God in anſwer to his Prayer gives him two Sons; and one of them was hated and reprobated before he was born? Our Saviour ſaith, <hi>What man is there of you, whom if his Son ask bread, will he give him a ſtone? Or if he ask a fiſh, will he give him a ſerpent?</hi> But how much beneath
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:185024:67"/>
evil Parents, doth this Objection render our Gracious God, who infinitely ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds in Goodneſs and Kindneſs to his Children all earthly Parents<hi>:</hi> For here his Child <hi>Iſaac</hi> begs a Boon of him, and he gives him <hi>one piece of bread, and one ſtone; one fiſh, and one ſerpent or ſcorpion;</hi> if this Objection would hold water<hi>: Mat.</hi> 7. 9-11.</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is not a word ſpoken of <hi>Gods hating</hi> Eſau <hi>before he was born,</hi> or of <hi>Gods hating</hi> Eſau perſonally conſidered, at any time<hi>:</hi> what was ſpoken <hi>before the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren were born, or had done good or evil,</hi> was this onely, <hi>The elder ſhall ſerve the younger;</hi> as may be plainly ſeen in <hi>Gen.</hi> 25. 23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11, 12. Nor was this ſpoken of his Perſon, but of his Poſterity<hi>:</hi> As evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently appears in <hi>Gen.</hi> 15. 23. <hi>Two Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are in thy Womb, and two manner of People ſhall be ſeparated from thy Bowels,</hi> &amp;c. And though in <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 11. thoſe words <hi>[the Children]</hi> are put in, yet they are not the words of God, but added by the Tranſlators, and therefore faithfully put in a different Character.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This ſerving <hi>Jacob</hi> Nationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, by <hi>Eſau</hi> Nationally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was not lookt upon, nor was out
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:185024:68"/>
of poſitive hatred; or as a Curſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to <hi>Eſau.</hi> It was not lookt upon by <hi>Iſaac</hi> as a Teſtimony of Gods poſitive hatred towards <hi>Eſau;</hi> for <hi>Iſaac</hi> loved him: Nay, it was a part of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to ſerve his Brother, Nationally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; (for perſonally he never ſo did:) and ſo ſignified to be; for this was a part of that <hi>Bleſſing</hi> wherewith his Father <hi>Iſaac bleſſed him:</hi> to wit, <hi>Thou ſhalt ſerve thy brother:</hi> Yea and in that he did <hi>bleſs him, and bleſs him by Faith, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things to come.</hi> It very plainly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that <hi>Eſau</hi> was not poſitively ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of God<hi>: Gen.</hi> 27. 39, 40. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 11. 20. Indeed, in that Oracle was ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified, that <hi>Jacob</hi> Nationally conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſhould in former Ages be preferred in Choice Priviledges and Advantages<hi>:</hi> they were the <hi>Church of God,</hi> and had his <hi>Oracles</hi> committed to them, <hi>&amp;c. Rom.</hi> 3. 1, 2. and Chap. 9. 4, 5. And <hi>of them, as concerning the fleſh, Christ came.</hi> But this was no hatred of <hi>Eſau,</hi> in their ſenſe<hi>:</hi> for <hi>in Christ there was, and is Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing for all the Nations and Families of the earth:</hi> Gen. 22. 16-18. and Ch. 26. 3, 4. &amp; 28. 13, 14. And any of them might have become <hi>Proſelites,</hi> and ſo have partaken
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:185024:68"/>
of their Advantages alſo: And doubtleſs there were good men deſcended from <hi>Eſau,</hi> as <hi>Job, Eliphaz,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Deut.</hi> 23. 7, 8.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And as with reſpect to that ſaying, Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted:</hi> That was not ſpoken before theſe two perſons were born, but long after they were dead<hi>:</hi> And therefore alſo it was not ſpoken of their perſons, but of their Poſterities, which ſtill retained their Name<hi>:</hi> And that <hi>hatred toward Eſau</hi> ſpoken of, was expreſt, not in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding him, or any of that Nation out of Heaven, in a perſonal conſideration; but in <hi>laying his Mountains, and his He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritage waste, for the Dragons of the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs.</hi> And if this was an Act of Hatred towards <hi>Eſau,</hi> Nationally conſidered<hi>:</hi> Then certainly, it was an Act of Love in God to give him formerly theſe Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and that Heritage. And the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why <hi>Eſau was thus hated and puniſhed,</hi> was, becauſe he did not ſerve his Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with theſe Mountains, but was an Enemy to him<hi>: Eſau was hated, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he had done good or evil;</hi> But becauſe of the wickedneſs of <hi>Eſau,</hi> Nationally conſidered, towards his Brother <hi>Jacob</hi> Nationally conſidered<hi>:</hi> As it is ſaid, <hi>For</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="tcp:185024:69"/>
               <hi>thy violence against thy Brother</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſhame ſhall cover thee, and thou ſhalt be cut off for ever. In the day that thou ſtood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt on the other ſide, in the day that the ſtrangers carried away captive his forces, and foreigners entred into his gates, and caſt lots upon</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>even thou waſt as one of them,</hi> &amp;c. Compare, <hi>Mal.</hi> 1, 2, 3. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> 35. and <hi>Obad.</hi> 9. 16. And the ſame Prophet that mentions theſe words; to wit, <hi>Eſau have I hated;</hi> ſignifies what the reaſon of his being hated was, to wit, becauſe of his wickedneſs<hi>:</hi> for ſo he ſaith, <hi>They ſhall call them the Border of wickedneſs, and the people againſt whom the Lord hath indignation for ever.</hi> Eſau was the People of Gods Indignation, as he was <hi>the Border of wickedneſs:</hi> And is not any other People ſo alſo? Mal. 1. 3. with ver. 4. So that by all we have ſaid, it evidently may appear unto any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering perſon, That <hi>Eſau</hi> Perſonally conſidered, was not poſitively hated, or reprobated of God before he was born; nor is any other ſo. And I have been the longer in giving <hi>Anſwer</hi> to this <hi>Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection,</hi> becauſe it is as uſually, as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably urged, to prove, That <hi>Eſau</hi> was, and ſo others may be, Reprobated
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:185024:69"/>
of God, <hi>hefore they have done good, or evil:</hi> Whereas indeed, There is not the leaſt colour or ground for ſuch a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion from the Scriptures in any one place<hi>:</hi> And ſo, notwithſtanding this <hi>Objection,</hi> which is altogether ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and ſandy, we conclude, as we have before ſaid; <hi>That God hath no pleaſure, none at all, in the Death of thoſe who are onely neceſſarily and unavoidably polluted:</hi> Nor ſhall any ſuch be caſt <hi>into the Lake which burneth with fire and brimstone, which is the ſecond Death;</hi> Pſal. 9. 17. Rev. 21. 8. and Chap. 22. 15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. In that <hi>the Lord God hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in the Death of the wicked,</hi> while they are joyned to all the living, as he here ſwears: Then it appears evidently and manifeſtly, That ſuch as do die and pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh eternally, are the Authors or Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curers of their own eternal Miſery and Ruine: And that <hi>their deſtruction is of themſelves</hi> wholly, as with reſpect to God<hi>:</hi> As the Lord ſaith to ſome of his profeſſed People in former times; <hi>O Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, thy corruption,</hi> or <hi>deſtruction, is of thy ſelf:</hi> Hoſ. 13. 9.

fallen, as to give his onely begotten Son to be their Saviour, that thorow him they might be ſaved: That Chriſt by the free Love and Charity of God, and by his own Grace, taſted Death for them, and roſe again for their Juſtification; and aſcended up on high, and led Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity Captive, and received gifts in the Man, even for the Rebellious alſo, that the Lord God might dwell among them: That when they came to years of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, God made known the love of the truth to them, to the end they might have been ſaved; and aſſiſted them, in order thereunto, with his Grace, and ſtrove with them by his Spirit, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince them of, and convert them from their ſins and vanities, to ſerve the living and true God: That yet, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, <hi>they rewarded him evil for good, and hatred for his love: That they trampled under foot the precious blood of Chriſt, the blood of the Covenant: And re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted and offered deſpight unto the Spirit of Grace:</hi> Heb. 10. 29. And <hi>deſpiſed all the riches of Gods goodneſs, and forbearance, and long-ſuffering vouchſafed to them:</hi> Rom. 2. 4-6. Oh! this, I ſay, being reflected on, will fill them with deſperate Grief,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:185024:72"/>
and Vexation of Spirit; That when it was Gods will they ſhould be ſaved, they would not ſo be<hi>: That when Chriſt would have gathered them, as an Hen gathereth her Chickens under her wings, they would not be gathered.</hi> Then they will blame themſelves onely, and even ſay, <hi>How have we hated inſtruction, and our heart deſpiſed reproof! we have not obeyed the voice of our teachers, nor inclined our ears to them that inſtructed us:</hi> Prov. 5. 7-13.

            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But againſt what hath been e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven now ſaid, ſome may object, and ſay, <hi>It evidently appears, that ſome Perſons were perſonally elected to ſalvation before they were born, yea before the foundation of the World:</hi> Eph. 1. 4. <hi>And therefore alſo it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follows, that ſome were then alſo perſonally reprobated, and must needs pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh hereafter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſw.</hi> To this Objection I ſhall more briefly give Anſwer, becauſe I have elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:185024:73"/>
largely conſidered it; and ſhewed ſome mens great miſtake concerning it<hi>:</hi> And therefore I ſhall here onely ſay,</p>
            <p>1. If it ſhould be granted, that the Apoſtle ſpeaks there directly of <hi>ſome mens being elected to Salvation, before the Dejection,</hi> or <hi>foundation of the World:</hi> Yet it appears evidently, <hi>that they were not choſen thereto in a perſonal conſideration;</hi> but as conſidered <hi>in Chriſt;</hi> and ſo as Believers in him: for the words are, <hi>He hath choſen us [in him] before the Dejection,</hi> or <hi>foundation of the World,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 4. After ſome ſuch conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as <hi>Levi paid Tithes in Abraham:</hi> Heb. 7. 9. It would be moſt abſurd and ridiculous to ſuppoſe, that that Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual perſon <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tithes to <hi>Mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſedech</hi> before he was born; but he did it in <hi>Abraham.</hi> So here no perſon is elected in a perſonal conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, before he is born; nor otherwiſe elected to Salvation but in Chriſt; to wit, as conſidered in him, who is the Root of Election, and the Prime Elect: That is to ſay, God in chooſing Chriſt before the Dejection of the World, did therein chooſe all thoſe who ſhould in their ſeveral Generations through Grace
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:185024:74"/>
believe, as Believers in him, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe. So that the ſame Perſon who to day doth not believe, and ſo is not in Chriſt, nor elected; yet to morrow believing, is then choſen in Chriſt, and made of that Generation, or Species, choſen in Chriſt before the Dejection of the World. <hi>He is now of the elect Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who,</hi> before he believed, <hi>was not of it:</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 9. 24-26. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 4, 5-9, 10. But,</p>
            <p>2. I further ſay, That <hi>Eph.</hi> 14. ſpeaks not of mens <hi>being choſen to ſalvation; but of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>me mens being choſen in Christ to an excellent miniſtration,</hi> or <hi>ſervice:</hi> And to a more excellent One than any be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore: Nor were they choſen thereto in a perſonal conſideration, but as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in Chriſt, and as Truſters in him; and as <hi>firſt Truſters in him:</hi> as <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 12. as plainly appears by the change of the perſons. In the two firſt <hi>Verſes</hi> of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle ſpeaks to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Epheſians,</hi> and ſaith unto them, <hi>Grace unto you,</hi> &amp;c. But then from <hi>verſe</hi> 3. <hi>to verſe</hi> 12. he ſpeaks not of them, but changes the perſons; never ſaith <hi>[You]</hi> but always <hi>[We]</hi> and <hi>[<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s;]</hi> to aſſure us, he ſpeaks of ſome others, and not of
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:185024:74"/>
them: And having ſo done, then in <hi>ver.</hi> 13. he again returns to, and ſpeaks of them, and ſaith, <hi>In whom ye alſo truſted,</hi> or believed, <hi>after ye heard the word of truth,</hi> &amp;c. So that all contained from <hi>ver.</hi> 3. to <hi>v.</hi> 12. reſpects thoſe that truſted in Chriſt before the <hi>Epheſians</hi> were <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> and ſo, before they were <hi>choſen:</hi> And <hi>ver.</hi> 4. particularly ſpeaks alſo of the Apoſtles, as Believers in Chri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>t, and Apoſtles, <hi>being choſen to the miniſtration, not of the Letter, but of the Spirit:</hi> as 2 Cor. 3. 5-10. That is to ſay in ſhort, God before the Dejection, or Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the World, choſe Chriſt to be the Mediatour, Saviour, and great Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle; and purpoſed to ſend him in the end of the World, actually to make peace for us, and to preach it to us, and reſerved this honour for him, <hi>That the myſtery which was hid from former Ages and Generations, ſhould by him be opened:</hi> He then alſo <hi>in Chriſt choſe the first Tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters in him,</hi> to be Inſtruments in this choice Service and Miniſtration, <hi>to preach the Goſpel according to the revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the myſtery:</hi> Eph. 1. 8-10, 11. As the Apoſtle elſe-where ſaith, <hi>We ſpeak the wiſdom of God in a myſtery, the hidden</hi>
               <pb n="132" facs="tcp:185024:75"/>
               <hi>wiſdom which God ordained before the world,</hi> or <hi>ages, unto our glory;</hi> to wit, for the Glory of the Apoſtles of the Lamb: which place is very ſuitable to the other, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. 7. with <hi>Epheſ</hi> 1. 4. And this is the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and direct meaning of <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1. 3, 4-12.</p>
            <p>Now this <hi>Election</hi> doth not ſuppoſe, that all others, beſides the Apoſtles, were reprobated to eternal Deſtruction; God forbid: But the very end of Gods chooſing them in Chriſt, to this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent Miniſtration, was, <hi>That the world there-through might be ſaved:</hi> Joh. 3. 17. with Chap. 17, 18. As <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now to him that is of power to eſtabliſh you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to my Goſpel, and the preaching of Jeſus Chriſt, according to the revelation of the myſtery, which was kept ſecret ſince the world began, but now is made manifeſt, and by the Scriptures of the Prophets, according to the Commandment of the everlasting God, made known [to all Nations, for the obedience of Faith:]</hi> Rom 1. 5. and Chap. 16. 25, 26. So that this Election was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the good of the whole world<hi>:</hi> And we ſtill conclude, That God is not willing that any ſhould periſh. And be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he hath no Pleaſure in the Death
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:185024:75"/>
of him that dieth, it neceſſarily follows, as hath been ſhewed, That their Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction who periſh, is wholly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, he hath no hand therein, nor heart thereto, while it is the day of his Grace and Patience.</p>
            <p>4. And laſtly, as to this, ſeeing God ſwears, <hi>That he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, in the death of him that dieth;</hi> as is before explained: Then hereby we may ſee and know who are like to God, and Children of him; and who they are that are not ſo.</p>
            <p n="1">1. They are not therein born of God, <hi>who privily bring in Hereſies of Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> or deſtructive Errors and Doctrines, ſuch as tend to the perdition of men; as thoſe certainly do, <hi>who teach men to deny the Lord that bought them:</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 1, 2. And do not theſe evil Doctrines do ſo, which teach, <hi>That Chriſt died not for all, nor taſted death by the Grace of God for every man, but onely for the Elect;</hi> as they ſpeak<hi>: That though God with his revealed Will would have all men to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, yet not ſo with his ſecret Will. That though he commands all men every where to Repent, yet he doth not vouchſafe ſuch ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient,</hi> or <hi>ſaving Grace, whereby they may</hi>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:185024:76"/>
               <hi>ſo do.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>That there is a certain de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminate number of Mankind elected in a perſonal conſideration, before the World was; and theſe ſhall be brought in to believe,</hi> in due ſeaſon, <hi>irreſiſtibly; and ſo preſerved, that they ſhall not poſſibly fail of the Grace of God, however they demean themſelves: and all the reſt are reprobated, and muſt neceſſarily,</hi> or <hi>ſhall infallibly periſh in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion; how much ſoever they indeavour to fly from the wrath to come,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Theſe, and ſuch like Doctrines; yea All ſuch as conſent not to wholſome Words, the Words of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the Doctrine according to Godlineſs, are not of God<hi>:</hi> Nor are ſuch of God therefore who plead for, or preach them<hi>:</hi> I mean, therein they are not of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies, in that Rule he gives the Belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers, whereby they might know which Prophets are of God, and which are not<hi>: We are of God,</hi> (ſaith he, namely, the holy Apoſtles were ſo, in their Word and Doctrine; for Chriſt gave unto them the Words which the Father gave him<hi>: John</hi> 17. 7, 8.) <hi>He that knoweth God heareth us: He that is not of God heareth us not: hereby know we the Spirit of truth,</hi>

To this purpoſe alſo the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle <hi>Paul</hi> Aſſerts of him, ſaying, <hi>God our Saviour will have all men to be ſaved;</hi> to wit, <hi>from their ſins:</hi> 1 Tim. 2. 4. with Matth. 1. 21.

Now then, in this Branch of the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject-matter of what the Lord God alſo ſwears to, there is plainly ſignified to us;</p>
            <p n="1">1. That as <hi>he hath no pleaſure in the death and eternal deſtruction of the wicked:</hi> So alſo he hath no Pleaſure in Sin, or in mens evil, ſinful, and wicked ways; <hi>He is not a God that h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

Sin is the moſt loathſom and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous thing to him that is: It is a deteſtable thing<hi>: Ezek.</hi> 11. 18. 21. As the Lord him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſignifies, ſaying, <hi>Howbeit I ſent unto you all my Servants the Prophets, riſing early, and ſending, ſaying, [O do not this abominable thing that I hate!]</hi> Jer. 44. 4. <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God; for God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man: but every man is tempted when he is drawn a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way of his own luſt, and enticed.—Do not erre, my beloved Brethren,</hi> ſaith James 1. 13, 14, 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Indeed, too too many there are, who take occaſion by his goodneſs, lenity, and
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:185024:80"/>
forbearance, to think and conclude, That God is well-pleaſed with their evil and wicked ways<hi>:</hi> According to that, <hi>Theſe things haſt thou done, and I kept ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; thou thoughteſt I was altogether ſuch an one as thy ſelf:</hi> Pſal. 50. 16-21. <hi>Ye have wearied the Lord with your words,</hi> ſaith the Prophet, <hi>yet ye ſay, wherein have we wearied him? when ye ſay, every one that doth evil is good in the ſight of the Lord, and he delighteth in them; or where is the God of judgment?</hi> Or, as it is rendred in a former Tranſlation, <hi>Where is the God that puniſheth?</hi> Mal. 2. 17. That is to ſay, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe God was long-ſuffering toward e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Doers, and did not preſently, or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely judge them, therefore ſome abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed his ſlowneſs to anger, and concluded, That he was not ſuch an Hater of ſin as indeed he is<hi>:</hi> Or, as the Preacher ſaith, <hi>Becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not ſpeedily executed, therefore the heart of the Sons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil:</hi> Eccl. 8. 11.</p>
            <p>Nay indeed, becauſe God is ſo ſlow to anger towards evil Doers, and ſo bountiful towards them, in filling their houſes with good things: Some holy men of God, though they have aſcribed
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:185024:81"/>
Righteouſneſs and Holineſs to their Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker, have yet been put to a <hi>ſtand,</hi> or to ſeek, how to reconcile ſuch like Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences with his Purity and Holineſs; for, or at ſome time: So the Prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> ſaith, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, when I plead with thee; yet let me talk with thee of thy judgments: Wherefore doth the way of the wicked proſper? Are all they happy that deal very treacherouſly? Thou haſt planted them, yea they take root; they grow, yea they bring forth fruit: thou art near in their mouth, and far from their reins:</hi> Pſal. 73. Jer. 12. 1, 2. So another Prophet ſaith, <hi>Art thou not from everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, O Lord my God, mine holy One?—Thou art of purer eyes than to behold evil, and canſt not look on iniquity: Wherefore lookeſt thou upon them that deal treacherouſly, and holdeſt thy Tongue when the wicked devour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the man that is more righteous than he?</hi> &amp;c. Hab. 1. 12, 13-17. and Chap. 2. 1-4. Job 10. 3.</p>
            <p>But whatever evil uſe wicked men make of his Goodneſs and Forbearance, and how painful or difficult ſoever it hath been, or may be, to good men, to reconcile theſe things with his Purity and Holineſs; as Pſal. 73. 16. yet without
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:185024:81"/>
all doubt, or peradventure, he is an holy Lord God: And <hi>there is none holy as the Lord, for there is none beſides him:</hi> as 1 Sam. 2. 2. And <hi>the way of the wicked is an abomination to him:</hi> Prov. 15. 9. He is a moſt perfect and eternal Hater of ſin, as plainly appears in his Word, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Inſtances of his ſeverity, that are therein propounded to us<hi>: He ſpared not the Angels that ſinned, but caſt them down to Hell, delivering them into chains of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be reſerved unto judgment. And ſpared not the old World—but brought in the Flood upon the World of the ungodly: And turning the Cities of</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morah <hi>into aſhes, condemned them with an overthrow, making them an enſample unto thoſe that after ſhould live ungodly:</hi> 2 Pet. 2. 4, 5, 6, 9, 10. <hi>He ſpared not the natural branches,</hi> but cut them off from the good Olive-tree, becauſe of their unbelief: <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 17-24, Yea if his own People ſin againſt him, <hi>he will viſit their tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions with the Rod, and their iniquity with ſtripes:</hi> Pſal. 89. 30-32. <hi>If I ſin a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt thee,</hi> ſaith that perfect and upright man, <hi>then thou markeſt me, and will not acquit me from mine iniquity:</hi> Job 10. 14, 15.

amongſt his People, but will puniſh them for their Iniquity, if they ſin againſt him; <hi>Moſes and</hi> Aaron <hi>among his Prieſts, and</hi> Samuel <hi>among them that call upon his Name. They called upon the Lord, and he anſwered them:—Thou anſweredſt them, O Lord, our God, thou waſt a God that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaveſt them, though thou tookeſt vengeance of their Inventions. Exalt the Lord our God, and worſhip at his holy hill; for the Lord our God is holy:</hi> Pſal. 99. 6. 9.</p>
            <p>Nay, when God laid upon his dear Son the Iniquities of us all<hi>:</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 53. 6. Though he was the man, his fellow, higher than all meer Creatures what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever; his Son by Nature: And though he was beloved of him with an higher degree of Love than all Saints and An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels in Heaven or on Earth; his belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Son, in whom he was well-pleaſed, and one whom he loved before the Foundation of the World: Yea, and though alſo, he was the Holy One of God, one who knew no ſin, who did no ſin, neither was Guile found in his mouth<hi>:</hi> One that never diſpleaſed his Father at any time, but always did thoſe things that pleaſed him<hi>:</hi> yet notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, when he himſelf bare

our ſins in his own Body on the Tree, <hi>he was wounded,</hi> or tormented, <hi>for our tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions, bruiſed for our iniquities; the chaſtiſement of our peace was upon him.—Yea, it pleaſed the Lord to bruiſe him, he put him to grief:</hi> Iſa. 53. 3-5, 6-10. When God made him ſin for us, who knew no ſin; <hi>God ſpared not his own,</hi> his proper <hi>Son, but delivered him up for us all:</hi> Rom. 8. 32. And though he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me? Why art thou ſo far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?</hi> God ſpared him not, but brought him into the duſt of death. He did not ſpare him for his crying, as it were; or though he offered up Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Supplications, with ſtrong cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and tears: as <hi>Heb.</hi> 5. 7. But whence came this to paſs, that God dealt thus with his Son? Was it becauſe he loved him not? No, that could not poſſibly be; but ſurely it was, becauſe of his infinite Purity and Holineſs, and hatred of our ſin, which was laid upon him. And ſo much our Lord plainly ſignifies, when he ſaith, <hi>O my God, I cry in the day-time, but thou hearest not,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—But thou art holy, O thou that inhabiteſt the Praiſes of Iſrael.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, <hi>Thou art ſuch a</hi>
               <pb n="148" facs="tcp:185024:83"/>
               <hi>perfect Hater of Sin, that thou muſt puniſh it, where-ever thou findeſt it.</hi> Yea though it be laid upon One <hi>who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled, ſeparate from ſinners,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 22. 1, 2, 3, 14, 15. Though he was a Lamb without <hi>blemiſh</hi> and without <hi>ſpot,</hi> yet our Iniquities being cauſed to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether on him, <hi>he ſuffered for them, the juſt for the unjuſt,—being put to death in the fleſh,</hi> &amp;c. 1 Pet. 2. 24. and Chap. 3. 18. Though he prayed, <hi>O my Father, if it be poſſible, let this Cup paſs,</hi> &amp;c. Yet in that it did not paſs from him, we may behold moſt clearly, and moſt com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably, Gods ſeverity againſt ſin: for <hi>that was the day of the vengeance of our God;</hi> In which he took vengeance of our Inventions, in the fleſh of that moſt innocent and ſpotleſs One; and which Day of Vengeance is now proclaimed in the Goſpel, <hi>to comfort all that mourn:</hi> as <hi>Iſa</hi> 61. 1, 2. According to what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>what the Law could not do, in that it was weak through the fleſh, God ſending his own Son in the likeneſs of ſinful fleſh, and for ſin,</hi> or by a Sacrifice for ſin, <hi>condemned ſin,</hi> our ſin <hi>in the fleſh;</hi> to wit, of his own dear and moſt innocent Son: <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 3. with 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 18. Herein then
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:185024:83"/>
we may moſt plainly behold the infinite Holineſs of the Lord God; and the hate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and abominableneſs of Sin to his Majeſty, even in the Croſs and Suffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt<hi>:</hi> and that he can never be reconciled thereto. Nor doth he hate it becauſe he hath forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den it ſimply; But he therefore forbad it, becauſe it is ſo deteſtable and loath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom to his Infinitely Pure Nature; for he is Holineſs it ſelf, Holineſs eſſentially: <hi>Amos</hi> 4. 2. with Chap. 6. 8.</p>
            <p>Oh then! when we read in the Holy Scriptures, or here there-from, of the Graciouſneſs of the Holy God towards us Sinners, of Mankind; And how loath he is with our Deſtruction, when we have propounded, or proclaimed to us this good News, That God ſwears, that <hi>as he lives, he hath no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> Let us not then pervert what is right, or imagine he thus ſwears in favour to mens ſinful ways and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. No, far be it from us to make ſuch a wicked uſe of ſuch a Bleſſed Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine<hi>: For there is no meat for our luſt in the Glad-tydings of the Glorious Goſpel.</hi> Let us not then ſay and conclude, That becauſe God is good to All, therefore
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:185024:84"/>
               <hi>we ſhall have peace, though we walk in the imagination, or ſtubbornneſs of our heart, to add drunkenneſs to thirſt; for then the Lord will not ſpare us: But then the anger of the Lord and his jealouſie will ſmoak against us,</hi> &amp;c. Deut. 29. 19-25. But let us wiſely conſider, <hi>That his Goodneſs leadeth to Repentance:</hi> Rom 2. 4. And <hi>his long-ſuffering is,</hi> and is to be accounted <hi>Salvation:</hi> The very end and deſign of God in the very exerciſe thereof, is, That we might receive the love of the truth, ſo as to be ſaved thereby from our ſins and vanities<hi>:</hi> 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 9, 15. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2. 4. <hi>The grace of God which bringeth ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to all men, teacheth to deny ungod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and worldly luſts, and to ſerve God acceptably, with reverence and godly fear: For our God is a conſuming fire:</hi> Tit. 2. 11, 12. Heb. 12. 28, 29. Look we then unto Jeſus Chriſt the Great and Fundamental Witneſs of Gods kindneſs and pity to ſinful Mankind; And yet alſo the clear Teſtimony of Gods Infinite Purity and hatred of Sin: And be we ſaved. And to that end, <hi>waſh we our hearts from wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs:</hi> Iſa. 45. 21, 22. Jer. 4. 14. Look in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Clefts of this Rock<hi>:</hi> Remember and conſider how this holy and juſt One
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:185024:84"/>
               <hi>humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto Death, the death of the Croſs;</hi> that ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, painful, and accurſed Death, for our ſins, to the end, <hi>that we being dead to ſin, might live to righteouſneſs.</hi> And therein we ſhall ſee the vileneſs and odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of ſin; that we may flee there-from as from that which is moſt perni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious and deſtructive to us.</p>
            <p>Indeed we are all naturally very prone and apt to turn the Grace of our God into laſciviouſneſs, and to make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the fleſh, to fulfil the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, by occaſion of the riches of Gods goodneſs diſplayed in the Goſpel. Hence the Apoſtle, when he had been largely declaring the love of God to Sinners, in that <hi>while we were yet without ſtrength, in due time Chriſt died for the ungodly.</hi> And that <hi>God commendeth his love towards us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for us.</hi> And that <hi>where ſin abounded, there grace abounded much more,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 5. He then ſees in needful to give Anſwer unto an Objection, which he judged ſome would make, or did make, againſt that Doctrine he had preached<hi>:</hi> Or to refute and remove an evil Inference ſome would draw from his right and
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:185024:85"/>
good Sayings; and therefore thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds, <hi>What ſay we then? ſhall we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in ſin that grace may abound?</hi> Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he gives us to underſtand, That too many would be ready thus to abuſe the words of Gods Grace fore-declared by him<hi>:</hi> But he rejects ſuch a Concluſion with greateſt Deteſtation, <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>far be it from us, or from any, thus to turn the truth of God into a lye,</hi> as we are too forward to do. <hi>How ſhall we that are dead to ſin,</hi> to wit, by the Death of Chriſt, <hi>live any longer therein?</hi> Rom. 6. 1, 2, 3. See alſo <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. 3-8. <hi>Gal.</hi> 5. 13. But now, to rhe end we may not think that what God ſwears to the truth of, is in favour to our ſins, but in love to our Souls<hi>:</hi> Therefore he not only ſwears Negatively, <hi>I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked.</hi> But alſo Affirmatively, <hi>But</hi> (I have plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) <hi>that the wicked turn from his way, and live.</hi> In which he plainly intimates to us his Abhorrency of Sin, while he aſſures us of his love to Sinners, and of his no-pleaſure in their everlaſting miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and perdition<hi>:</hi> That none of us ſhould wreſt his Sayings to our own deſtruction<hi>:</hi> as 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. 16. But to this we may have
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:185024:85" rendition="simple:additions"/>
further occaſion to ſpeak ſomewhat in what follows; and therefore ſhall here add no more to it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that this is alſo contained in what the Lord God ſwears to, to wit, <hi>That the wicked turn from his way, and live.</hi> Herein is alſo intimated to us, <hi>That the wicked may tur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

               </hi> while it is called to Day, <hi>from his wicked ways, and live.</hi> He may turn there-from poſſibly, and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsfully. This is alſo implied and ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this Oath: For we cannot rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably believe, that this moſt Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent One would ſo ſolemnly ſwear, that he hath pleaſure in that which is utterly impoſſible for his Creatures to do; or which he doth not render or make poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible unto them: as we may afterwards further ſhew.

            <p>And in his <hi>Name</hi> there is preached Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto all Nations, even unto the greateſt and moſt notorious Sinners, while men are joyned to all the living. And our Lord Jeſus was ſent, and came, <hi>not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> And anſwerably did ſo, even the greateſt Sinners, while he was upon the Earth. <hi>Matth.</hi> 9. 11-13. <hi>Mark</hi> 1. 14, 15<hi>:</hi> And ſent forth his Apoſtles to preach, not the Law, but the Goſpel, <hi>that men might repent:</hi> Matth. 10. 7. with <hi>Mark</hi> 6. 12. So when he was Raiſed again from the

ſaid; But alſo becauſe he who thus calls and commands them, doth alſo enable them ſo to do; eſpecially where the Scriptures are vouchſafed, and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel is plainly preached to men: The wiſdom of God doth not only call unto ſuch as have long loved ſimplicity, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighted in ſcorning, and hated know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; and ſaith, <hi>Turn ye at my reproof:</hi> But to encourage and enable them ſo to do, ſhe adds, <hi>Behold</hi> (mind and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der this well) <hi>I will pour out my ſpirit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you;</hi> (to wit, to ſtrengthen them to what ſhe requires of them:) ſhe doth not call them to repentance ſimply, but alſo <hi>ſtretcheth forth her hand,</hi> to help their Infirmity and relieve their Impotency; <hi>Prov.</hi> 1. 22, 23, 24.

But we are aſſured from the teſtimony of the Lord, that he who ſent his Son into the world, to be the Saviour of the

Our Lord Jeſus did promiſe, that he would be with his Goſpel, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarers of it, <hi>unto the end of the world: to open the eyes of Jews and Gentiles, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God:</hi> That they might turn from the evil of their thoughts and ways<hi>:</hi> And faithful is he that promiſed, who alſo will do it; <hi>Mat.</hi> 28. 20. with <hi>Mar.</hi> 16. 15. 20. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 17, 18, 23. <hi>The law of the LORD is perfect, converting the ſoul;</hi> for it is <hi>the law of the ſpirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> Pſal. 19. 7. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 8. 2.

And they that reſiſt the Goſpel, reſiſt not man, but God, who alſo hath given the Preachers

of it his holy Spirit, to accompany them, and work together with them; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they are able Miniſters. And hence alſo <hi>Stephen</hi> ſaith to the Jews, <hi>Ye ſtiff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necked and uncircumciſed in heart and ears, ye do alwayes reſiſt the holy Spirit; as your fathers did, ſo do ye:</hi> 1 Theſ. 4. 8. Acts 7. 51. <hi>In God's hand is power and might, and in his hand it is—to give strength unto all;</hi> 1 Chron. 29. 12. <hi>And he giveth unto all men liberally, and upbraideth not;</hi> Jam. 1. 5. with chap. 4. 5. 6.</p>
            <p>And indeed, That the wicked may poſſibly turn from their wicked ways and live: I mean, That God doth give un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to them ſufficient Grace and Power ſo to do, while he calls upon them ſo to do; is clearly implied in his Oath: In that he ſo ſolemnly ſwears that he hath pleaſure that they turn from their ways and live; as is before ſaid<hi>:</hi> For how can he be ſaid to have pleaſure in their converſion, who knows they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not poſſibly convert themſelves; and yet, though he hath power in his hand to in able them thereto, doth not exert it, or give them ſo much as whereby they might be converted and turned there-from unto him? If we ſhould ſee a man
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:185024:89" rendition="simple:additions"/>
ready to fall into ſome deep ditch or pit, in which he will unavoidably pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh; and know he cannot poſſibly keep himſelf out of it, but muſt fall into it neceſſarily, unleſs ſome other preſerve him from that imminent danger: And ſome one or more of us ſhould ſeriouſly aſſure the man, That we are not pleaſed that he ſhould fall into that dangerous place<hi>:</hi> Nay, we ſwear moſt ſolemnly to the truth hereof alſo. If notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all this, we never put forth our hand to keep him back from thus fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, no not ſo much as a fingar, which might preſerve him from that deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, can it be reaſonably believed that we ſware what we thought: And not rather, that we inſulted over that pite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous perſon in that his miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? So alſo it is here<hi>:</hi> Our good and gracious, and infinitely wiſe God, knows what a ſad ſtate wicked ones are in<hi>:</hi> That they are even at the brink of the pit of eternal ruin and perdition; and that they have no power at all to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver themſelves<hi>: That they cannot deliver their ſouls, nor ſay, is there not a lie in our right hands?</hi> As <hi>Iſa.</hi> 44. 20. now he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſes himſelf by an Oath, and ſwears,
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:185024:89"/>
he hath pleaſure they ſhould be kept from that euerlaſting deſtruction: And if he now afford them no power at all that they might be delivered there-from, what may we think of ſuch an Oath, or of him who thus Sweareth? Can we believe he ſpeaks as he thinks, or thinks as he ſwears? No ſurely. Our Saviour ſignifies, <hi>that he who doth not ſave life,</hi> when it is in the Power of his hand, and he hath opportunity ſo to do, <hi>doth deſtroy;</hi> though he never ſwears he hath no pleaſure in ſuch a deſtruction, but that he ſhould be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved<hi>: Mark</hi> 3. 4. See <hi>Iam.</hi> 4. 17. Much rather may he be ſaid ſo to do, who binds his ſoul with an Oath, That it is his good pleaſure that ſuch an one ſhould be cured and delivered from his deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive diſtemper; and yet with-holds all help from him, in order therto, which he might with the greateſt eaſe reach forth unto him. Indeed, if ſuch an one doth give the dying perſon a plaiſter to heal him, and helps him to apply it, if then the periſhing perſon refuſes, his blood will juſtly be upon his own head: But otherwiſe, he is to be pitied; and the ſwearing and potent perſon to be
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:185024:90"/>
blamed<hi>:</hi> But let all ſuch thoughts of God, who is love it ſelf to man-ward, be rejected by us<hi>:</hi> He that had ſo much love in his heart, as to move him to ſwear with his lips, That <hi>he hath pleaſure that the wicked ſhould turn,</hi> doth doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs in able them, though not force them, ſo to do.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay (as it is frequently urged by ſome) <hi>That God gave men pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in</hi> Adam, <hi>in the ſtate of Innocency, to obey his will, and keep his commands: And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he may ſtill command them to turn, though they have no power, becauſe they loſt it themſelves: But he loſt not his Authority over them.</hi> To this I ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. We are not now conſidering what Authority he hath to command, but what Affection and Good-will he ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies to be in his heart toward wicked ones by his Oath, both negatively and poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively propounded; and from thence conclude, That he who ſo ſwears, will certainly not be wanting to afford <hi>that</hi> to wicked ones, whereby they may be preſerved from Death; and may turn from their wicked ways and live. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. We utterly deny, That God ever gave wicked ones power in the firſt <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam,</hi>
               <pb n="163" facs="tcp:185024:90"/>
to turn from their wicked ways and live. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There were no wicked ones in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam</hi> before he fell<hi>:</hi> for <hi>God made man righteous,</hi> to wit, <hi>Adam,</hi> and all in him; <hi>Eccl.</hi> 7. 29. <hi>God made man in his own Image, in the Image of God created he him; male and female created he them:</hi> Gen. 1. 26, 27. Nor did any, nor could any ſin while in <hi>Adam</hi>'s loins, before he ſinned: For <hi>by that one man ſin entred into the world,</hi> &amp;c. Rom. 5. 12-18.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When <hi>Adam</hi> had eaten of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden fruit, he had no power to convert himſelf; which he would have had, had God given him power ſo to do<hi>: The firſt Adam was</hi> indeed <hi>made a living ſoul;</hi> and ſo might and ſhould have convayed life to his Poſterity, had he abode in that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable ſtate in which he was created of God<hi>:</hi> But he was not made a <hi>Quickening ſpirit</hi> to Quicken himſelf, or his off-ſpring when he was fallen from God, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come dead thereby: It is <hi>the laſt Adam</hi> and not the firſt, that <hi>was made a quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit;</hi> 1 Cor. 15. 45. And how ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous is it to ſuppoſe, That God gave ſinners power in the firſt <hi>Adam</hi> to repent, when they were not ſinners, and ſo
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:185024:91"/>
needed no repentance; and deveſted them of it, when they had ſinned, and ſo need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it: and yet ſtill commands them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, when he gives them no power ſo to do, nor ever did, when they needed repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance<hi>:</hi> as the Objectors themſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Nor is any man in Scripture ever called <hi>wicked,</hi> becauſe he ſinned in the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> or was neceſſarily polluted from him ſimply; as hath been formerly ſaid: What <hi>Adam</hi> himſelf might be, we diſpute not<hi>:</hi> but none of his poſterity were ſo, upon the account of that ſin and ſinfulneſs, of which they unavoidably partook<hi>:</hi> But men are ſo called and reckoned, becauſe of their own perſonal and voluntary tranſgreſſions. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſure, the wicked had never power given them in the firſt Publick man, to repent and turn from their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs; ſo that this is but a lying and groundleſs Refuge. And if God doth not now give them power to repent, he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver gave them power to repent; but when once they become wicked, ſuch muſt periſh unavo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dably who do periſh; becauſe they never had power given to them to turn from their wickedneſs and
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:185024:91"/>
live<hi>:</hi> and yet ſtill God ſwears <hi>he hath pleaſure that they ſhould turn and live.</hi> Would to God thoſe perſons who thus object, would ſeriouſly conſider theſe things; <hi>That they might not ſpeak thus wickedly for God, and talk ſo deceitfully for him,</hi> as <hi>Job</hi> 13. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>Nay, That God doth give power to wicked ones alſo to repent, while it is the day of his Grace and Patience, is not only ſtrongly and undeniably inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated in this Oath we are now conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing<hi>:</hi> but alſo very plainly and evidently aſſured us in another Oath, which God ſware to out Father <hi>Abraham;</hi> mentioned thus by <hi>Zacharias, who was filled with the Holy Ghoſt</hi> when he ſpake<hi>: The Oath,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>which he ſware to our father</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, <hi>That he would grant, or give, unto us; That we being delivered out of the hands of our enemies, might ſerve him without fear; in holineſs and righteouſneſs, before him all the days of our lives:</hi> Luke 1. 73, 74, 75.</p>
            <p>Now in this Oath, There are two things mainly contained, and which are neceſſary to our turning to God from our iniquities, to ſerve the living and true God; and which God ſware to <hi>Abraham</hi> in that Oath<hi>: Gen.</hi> 22. 16 18. referred to by <hi>Zacharias,</hi> to wit,</p>
            <p n="1">

1. That he would in and by Chriſt. <hi>that Horn of Salvation,</hi> deliver <hi>us out of the hands,</hi> or power, <hi>of our enemies.</hi> This is contained in that Oath, <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 17. <hi>Thy ſeed,</hi> to wit, Chriſt, (for of him it is principally meant, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. 16.) <hi>ſhall poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the gate of his enemies:</hi> to wit, their power and ſtrength; as <hi>Matth.</hi> 16. 18. And <hi>for this purpoſe hath the Son of God been</hi> now <hi>manifeſted, that he might destroy the works of the Devil:</hi> 1 Joh. 3. 8. And <hi>he hath bound the ſtrong man,</hi> Matth. 12. 29. <hi>he hath thorow death deſtroyed him that had the power of death:</hi> that is, <hi>the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> Heb. 2. 9, 14, 15. <hi>he hath ſpoiled prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipalities and powers, and made a ſhew of them openly, triumphing over them in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi> Col. 2. 15. he hath deveſted our ſpiritual enemies of their power, and he poſſeſſes the power over us<hi>: Joh.</hi> 12. 30, 31. And <hi>worthy is the Lamb, that was ſlain, to receive power and riches and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and ſtrength,</hi> &amp;c. Rev. 5. 11, 12. Matth. 28. 18. ſo that we are not now neceſſarily under the power of <hi>Satan,</hi> or any of the enemies of our ſouls<hi>:</hi> For Chriſt hath broken the head of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſpoiled his Plot, and deveſted him of his principality and power over us<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="167" facs="tcp:185024:92"/>
And the Tidings hereof are Glad-tidings of great ioy unto all people: Hence all people are called upon to <hi>clap hands:</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe <hi>God,</hi> the great God and our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>is gone up with a ſhout,</hi> (in token of Maſtery and Triumph<hi>: Exod.</hi> 32. 18.) <hi>The LORD with the ſound of a Trumpet: Sing praiſes to our God, ſing praiſes, ſing praiſes to our King ſing praiſes: for God is the King of all the earth,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 47. 1-7. <hi>O ſing unto the LORD a new ſong, for he hath done marvellous things; his right hand, and his holy arm, hath gotten him the victory.—Make a joyful noiſe unto the LORD, all the earth: Make a loud noiſe, and rejoyce and ſing praiſe. Sing unto the LORD with the hatp, with the harp and the voice of a Pſalm,</hi> &amp;c. Pſal. 98. 1-4-6. with <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68. 18. <hi>Satan</hi> is not now our Lord, as other-wiſe he would have been, but Chriſt is Lord of all: <hi>Acts</hi> 10. 36. <hi>for to this end Chriſt both died, and roſe, and revived, that he might Lord it over the quick and dead:</hi> Rom. 14. 9. So that that part of the Oath is now actually fulfilled by the appearing of our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>who hath aboliſhed death;</hi> and ſo ſaved us before he called us; even <hi>delivered us out of the hands of our enemies:</hi> 2 Tim. 1. 10.
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:185024:93"/>
with. ver. 9, And who therefore died for all, and roſe again, <hi>That they which live</hi> (in their ſeveral ages and generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) <hi>might no longer live unto themſelves, but unto him who died for them, and roſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain:</hi> 2 Cor. 5. 14, 15. But</p>
            <p n="2">2. God moreover ſware, or there was further contained in that Oath which he ſware to our father <hi>Abraham, That he would give, or grant, unto us:</hi> Namely, That he would <hi>Gran<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>
               </hi> unto us that <hi>Grace,</hi> power, aid and aſſiſtance, <hi>whereby we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing delivered,</hi> as aforeſaid, <hi>might ſerve him.</hi> See <hi>Rom.</hi> 15. 5. <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 16. <hi>Rev.</hi> 11. 3. He not only ſware that we ſhould be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered out of the power of them that hated us: but alſo, <hi>that he would give, or grant, unto us that whereby we migbt,</hi> not muſt, <hi>ſerve him.</hi> And indeed, this is needful to our being converted unto him, and that we ſhould ſerve him acceptably; namely, that grace be given unto us<hi>:</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 28. And therefore alſo God ſware, <hi>that he would grant unto us:</hi> which part of his Oath, as mentioned by <hi>Zacha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rias,</hi> reſpects that in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18. to wit, <hi>And in thy ſeed</hi> (namely, <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as is ſaid) <hi>ſhall all the nations of the earth be bleſſed:</hi> In which Branch of the Oath, theſe two things are contained:</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="169" facs="tcp:185024:93"/>
1. That he would give, or grant, unto us, in Chriſt, as in a Treaſury, all grace and bleſſing: even in him who died for All, and roſe again from the dead for their Juſtification; and obtained a compleat victory over all our enemies<hi>:</hi> ſuitable to that, <hi>Thou haſt aſcended up on high</hi> (even thou Lord Ieſus, who didſt deſcend into the lower parts of the Earth;) <hi>thou haſt led captivity captive, thou haſt received gifts in the man,</hi> or <hi>for men; yea</hi> for <hi>the rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious alſo, that the Lord God migbt dwell</hi> among them<hi>:</hi> Pſal. 68. 10, 18. And <hi>he is full of Grace and Truth,</hi> that out of his fulneſs we might receive: Joh. 1. 14. <hi>In him it hath pleaſed all the fulneſs to dwell: In him dwelleth all the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodily: And in him are we compleat, who is the head of all principality and power:</hi> Col. 1. 18, 19 and Ch. 2. 9, 10. <hi>This is the record, that God hath given to us</hi> (mankind) <hi>eternal life, and this life is in his Son:</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 10, 11, 12. And in that he hath received Gifts of Grace and Bleſſing, even for the wicked and rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious ones alſo, we need not fear, or doubt, but that he, who had ſo great love towards the worſt of men, as to die for them while they were ungodly and
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:185024:94"/>
wicked ones: <hi>Rom.</hi> 5. 6. will alſo give grace unto them in due ſeaſon prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, to turn them from the evil of their ways and doings<hi>:</hi> for <hi>he is good and upright, therefore will he teach ſinners in the way;</hi> Pſal. 25. 8. Iſa. 42. 1, 6, 7. But yet further,</p>
            <p n="2">2. There is alſo contained in this Branch of the Oath, which God ſware to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That in his ſeed, to wit, <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> ſinful ones ſhould be bleſſed; that is, that grace ſhould be given unto them, in and by Chrſt, to turn them from their ſinful ways; or as here <hi>Zacharias</hi> explains it, <hi>That be would grant unto them.</hi> And ſo alſo the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicates this branch of the Covenant, or Oath—made to <hi>Abraham,</hi> ſaying to the Jews, <hi>ye are the children</hi> of<hi>—the Covenant which God made with our fathers,</hi> namely, with<hi>—Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob: ſaying unto Abraham</hi> (to wit, in <hi>Gen.</hi> 22. 18) <hi>And in thy ſeed ſhall all the kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds—of the earth be—bleſſed.</hi> But what is meant by, or contained in that Covenant, or Oath? The Apoſtle ſhews us in the next words, namely, That he would grant unto all, however where the Goſpel and Scriptures are vouchſafed,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:185024:94"/>
Grace and Power, that they may repent and turn from their Iniquities<hi>:</hi> for ſo much the Apoſtle plainly ſignifies in what immediately follows, ſaying, <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you firſt, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you, in turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away every one of you from his ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities.</hi> Which evidently ſhews unto us what is contained in that Oath, as alſo it is explained by <hi>Zacharias,</hi> as is ſaid: That is, that God therein ſware, That he would grant that grace and bleſſing, to turn them preventingly, that they might turn thereby, and ſo receive further and following grace and bleſſing<hi>: Act.</hi> 3. 25, 26. <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 5, 6. Yea, let this alſo be conſidered, That the Apoſtle pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounds this as a further Argument, to move and perſwade them, who had cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified the Lord of Glory, to repent; whereto he had exhorted them<hi>: Act.</hi> 3. 19. <hi>Repent,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>and be converted:</hi> And uſing other Motives to inforce that Exhortation in ver. 19-24. he then, I ſay, to excite and prevail with them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, aſſures them, That God had ſworn to <hi>Abraham,</hi> That he would give them grace ſo to do: and now ſent Chriſt in the Goſpel to bleſs them, in turning them by
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:185024:95"/>
his grace: ver. 25, 26. Let the ſcope of the place be conſidered.</p>
            <p>If any ſhould ſay, That though it ſhould be granted, That God did in that Oath ſwear, <hi>That he would grant grace and power for turning;</hi> yet this muſt not be ſo extended, as to reach unto all: For <hi>Zacharias</hi> ſaith, <hi>That he would grant unto [us] &amp;c.</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> That the oath reſpects all, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever all to whom the Goſpel ſhould be plainly preached, and who are within the pale of the Church; as they ſpeak: And we can ſpeak to none other: for it is thus made, <hi>In thy ſeed ſhall [all the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the earth be bleſſed.]</hi> Gen. 22. 18. and 26. 4. <hi>[All the families of the earth,]</hi> Gen. 28. 14. <hi>[All the kindreds of the earth,]</hi> Act. 3. 25. And <hi>Peter</hi> ſaith not, <hi>[unto you, God having raiſed up his Son Jeſus, ſent him to bleſs you,</hi> &amp;c.] But, <hi>unto you [firſt,]</hi> &amp;c. Firſt unto the Jews, to turn every one of them: and ſecondly, to the Gentiles, to turn every one of them<hi>:</hi> According to that ſaying, <hi>Delivering thee from the people</hi> (to wit, of <hi>Iſrael) and the Gentiles, unto whom now I ſend thee: To open their eyes, and to turn them from darkneſs to light, and from the power of Satan unto God: that they</hi>
               <pb n="173" facs="tcp:185024:95"/>
               <hi>may receive forgiveneſs of ſins,</hi> &amp;c. In pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance whereof, ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>I ſhewed firſt unto them of</hi> Damaſcus, <hi>and at</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>and through-out all the Coaſts of</hi> Judea, <hi>and then to the Gentiles, that they ſhould repent, and turn to God, and do works meet for repentance:</hi> Act. 3. 26. with Chap. 26. 17, 18, 20-23. So that by what hath been noted from the Scriptures, it doth very plainlyappear, That while God gives the wicked ſpace of repentance, and calls them thereto, he alſo gives unto them, yea he hath ſworn, that he will give unto them, ſufficient grace<hi>:</hi> whereby they may turn from their evil ways and live. And I have the longer inſiſted upon the evidencing the truth hereof, becauſe there are many zealous ones, who affirm, That God doth indeed call all to repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with an outward call; but they deny that he gives ſufficient, or ſaving grace, unto all ſo called thus to do<hi>:</hi> And ſo they render his Commandements, which are eaſie, <hi>Matth.</hi> 11. 30. to be grievous, yea impoſſible to be obſerved by the moſt of men<hi>:</hi> and as if he requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red them <hi>to make brick without ſtraw:</hi> Whereas, <hi>his commandements are not grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous:</hi> 1 Joh. 5. 3. <hi>He is no hard or auſtere</hi>

But I ſhall ſpeak no more unto this parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
            <p n="3">3. As the wicked may poſſibly turn from their evil ways, ſo alſo they may turn there-from hopefully and ſucceſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully: <hi>They may turn and live:</hi> For he who calls and enables them to repent, is, <hi>A God pardoning iniquity and ſin and tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion:</hi> Exod. 34 5, 6.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:185024:96"/>
having accepted his ſacrifice <hi>(Heb.</hi> 9. 22. <hi>Job</hi> 33. 24.) is a God of Pardons: <hi>Neh.</hi> 9. 17. And ſets this before wicked ones, That he will aſſuredly forgive them, upon their ſincere turning to him<hi>:</hi> As he ſaith, <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the man of iniquity his thoughts: and let him return unto the LORD, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will multiply to pardon: For my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my wayes; ſaith the LORD: for as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens are higher than the earth, ſo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts:</hi> Iſa. 55. 6, 7, 8, 9. <hi>If the wicked will turn from all his ſins that he hath committed, and keep all my ſtatutes, and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die:</hi> All his <hi>tranſgreſſions that he hath commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, they ſhall not be mentioned unto him; in his righteouſneſs that he hath done, he ſhall live.</hi> Again, <hi>when the wicked man turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive: becauſe he conſidereth and turneth away from all his tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not dye:</hi> Ezek.

And ſo much is alſo ſignified in this Oath of the Lords we are ſpeaking unto, namely, That wicked ones may turn ſucceſsfully; for he doth not only ſwear, <hi>That he hath pleaſure that they ſhould turn,</hi> But, <hi>That they ſhould turn from their evil ways and live;</hi> to wit, Be forgiven their ſins, and received into his favour, <hi>in whoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour is Life; Hoſe.</hi> 14. 2. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30. 5. <hi>In returning and reſt they ſhall be ſaved,</hi> though formerly they have been rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lious People, <hi>lying Children, Children that would not hear the Law of the Lord;</hi> as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30. 8, 9, 10, 11-15-18. But I ſhall add no more to this Obſervation, only I ſhall deſire to add ſomewhat briefly, by way of uſefulneſs therefrom<hi>:</hi> As to ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. In that the wicked may, while it is called to day, poſſibly and ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully turn from their evil ways. We may learn from hence, as is before
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:185024:98"/>
ſaid, That the Lord God hath no plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in their Eternal Ruin and Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction<hi>:</hi> for therefore he commands and inables them to turn from <hi>that,</hi> in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing wherein they will wrong and deſtroy their own Souls. And hereby the Lord himſelf doth ſignifie to us, <hi>That he is not willing the wicked ſhould periſh:</hi> In that he encourages and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citates them to turn from their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious ways<hi>: But if the Wicked will turn,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>from all his ſins that he hath committed,—and do that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. All his Tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, they ſhall not be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned vnto him; in his Righteouſneſs that he hath done he ſhall live. Have I any pleaſure at all that the Wicked ſhould die? ſaith the Lord GOD, Ezek.</hi> 18. 21-23. plainly giving us to underſtand, That it is hereby manifeſted that he hath no pleaſure in their Death: In that he makes it poſſible to them to turn from the way of Death, and propounds ſuch Encouragements and Motives to prevail with them ſo to do.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In that the wicked ones may poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly and ſucceſsfully, even with En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:185024:98"/>
turn from their deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive ways; herein appears, and here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by we may behold, <hi>That the ways of the LORD are equal and righteous, in the Adminiſtration of his Government.</hi> Thus the Lord evinceth, and evidenceth the Equalneſs and Righteouſneſs of his ways unto the Jews, who charged them with Injuſtice; or Inequality: <hi>Ye ſay, the way of the LORD is not equal: Hear now, O Houſe of Iſrael, is not my way equal? Are not your ways unequal?—When the wicked turneth away from his wickedneſs that he hath committed, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his Soul alive: Becauſe he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereth and turneth away from all his Tranſgreſſions that he hath committed, he ſhall ſurely live, he ſhall not die. Yet ſaith the Houſe of Iſrael, the way of the LORD is not equal: O Houſe of Iſrael, are not my ways equal? are not your ways unequal? Ezek.</hi> 18. 21-25-27-29. and <hi>ch.</hi> 33. 14-17-20. If he ſhould doom them to the vengeance of Eternal Fire, for not doing what they cannot do, and he gives them not Grace to do<hi>:</hi> or if they ſhould turn from their evil ways, and yet not be forgiven, and received gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly;
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:185024:99"/>
his ways would not appear to be Juſt and Equal<hi>:</hi> whereas the Juſtice and Equalneſs of them herein clearly appears, in that he ſo impowers and encourages them to forſake their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous ways and thoughts<hi>:</hi> As hath been ſaid before.</p>
            <p n="3">3. We may from hence alſo learn, That thoſe who continue in their ſinful and wicked ways, and will not turn there-from, until ſin be finiſhed, and brings forth Death, will have none to blame for it but themſelves; or howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, they will have no juſt cauſe to blame God for it<hi>: Jam.</hi> 1. 13-15.

If they had this to plead for themſelves, That they could not turn themſelves from their iniquity and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and God gave them no grace ſo to do; this would be a good excuſe for themſelves. But this Plea will not avai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">

to turn our ſelves, yet <hi>God giveth more grace</hi> (that we might not follow our own ſpirit, or obey it in the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of<hi>:) Wherefore he ſaith, God reſiſteth the proud</hi> (who receive not, or receive not to purpoſe; that more grace, ſo as to be ſaved thereby;) <hi>but giveth grace</hi> (to wit, following and more abundant grace) <hi>to the humble:</hi> Jam. 4. 5, 6. with 2 Theſſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.

            <p n="4">4. Seeing <hi>the wicked may turn from their evil ways and live,</hi> and it is Gods good will and pleaſure they ſhould ſo do; whereto alſo he is inabling them by his grace and ſpirit<hi>:</hi> Let ſuch then be encouraged, moved, and prevailed withal, to repent and turn from all their tranſgreſſions. As <hi>Samuel</hi> ſaith unto the people of <hi>Iſrael, Ye have done all this wickedneſs, yet turn not aſide from follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the LORD, but ſerve the LORD with all your heart: and turn ye not aſide, for then ſhould ye go after vain things; which cannot proflt, nor deliver, becauſe they are vain:</hi> 1 Sam. 12. 20, 21.

Lovers, and though your tongue and your doings have been againſt the Lord, to provoke the eyes of his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; yet in returning to him from your ranſgreſſions, he will have mercy upon you. O then ſay as they did, when they were called to repentance, and put your words into Act: <hi>Behold, we come unto thee, for thou art the LORD our God:</hi> Jer. 3. 22-25. But to this alſo we may ſpeak ſomewhat further; and therefore ſhall not enlarge to it here.</p>
            <p n="3">3. And Laſtly, From the Affirmative Branch of the Oath of the Lord <hi>GOD,</hi> in which he ſwears, <hi>That he hath plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that the wicked turn from his way, and live,</hi> We may note, That the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed muſt turn or periſh<hi>:</hi> There is an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute neceſſity for their turning, that they may live; for <hi>without holineſs no man ſhall ſee the Lord:</hi> Heb. 12. 14. <hi>If they will ſtill do wickedly, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed,</hi> as, 1 Sam. 12. 25. Or as our Saviour ſaith, <hi>Except</hi> they <hi>repent,</hi> they <hi>will all periſh;</hi> Luk. 13. 3, 5. Though God hath manifeſted his love to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and manifeſted himſelf to be Love and Charity it ſelf, in ſending his Son the Saviour of the World; yet he

               <hi>Anſ.</hi> Now in anſwer hereto, and for the ſakes of ſome who conclude their caſe to be wholly hopeleſs, and utterly remedileſs, when it is not ſo, I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire,
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:185024:104"/>
with what brevity I may, to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and ſpeak ſomething to thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scriptures fore-mentioned<hi>: viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As to that <hi>Sin,</hi> or <hi>Blaſphemy, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> ſet down in <hi>Mat.</hi> 12. 31, 32, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Mind we theſe things, to wit,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The nature of this hainous ſin<hi>:</hi> And that is, It is a ſinning againſt the evident and convincing Demonſtration of the Holy Spirit, in his glorifying Chriſt; as may be ſeen in the Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſts, however in <hi>Matthew</hi> and <hi>Mark.</hi> Thus it is expreſt in the former, <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſpeaketh a word againſt the Son of man</hi> (namely, as I conceive, againſt him, as one that had no form nor comelineſs; who appeared as a worm, and no man, a reproach of men, and deſpiſed of the people; and ſo ſpake againſt him through ignorance, and as carried an end by the common ſtream of others) <hi>it ſhall be forgiven him: But whoſoever ſpeaketh</hi> (or <hi>blaſphemeth,</hi> Luk. 12. 10.) <hi>againſt the Holy Ghoſt</hi> (that is to ſay, againſt the clear evidence and demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of the Holy Spirit, in his bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing witneſs of Chriſt) <hi>it ſhall not be forgiven him,</hi> &amp;c. Now, that this is the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:185024:105"/>
nature of this Sin, or Blaſphemy, doth plainly appear by the occaſion of our Saviour's thus ſpeaking; which was this, Our Saviour had wrought a very great miracle <hi>in healing one that was poſſeſſed with a Devil, blind and dumb;</hi> Matth. 12. 22. whereat <hi>all the people were amazed, and ſaid, Is not this the Son of David?</hi> They were by this miraculous cure convinced that he was the <hi>Meſſias, But when the Phariſees</hi> (and ſome <hi>Scribes,</hi> Mark 3. 22.) <hi>beard it, they ſaid</hi> (as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that would not ſee, when Gods hand was ſo highly lifted up) <hi>This</hi> fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low <hi>doth not caſt out Devils, but by Beel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zebub,</hi> &amp;c. Now upon this occaſion our Saviour ſpeaks the words fore-expreſſed, and ſo ſhews what the hainous nature of their ſin was; namely, an attributing that to the work of the Devil, which was evidently wrought by the <hi>ſpirit (and finger,</hi> Luk. 11. 20.) <hi>of God:</hi> The which is alſo clearly ſignified by St. <hi>Mark,</hi> thus, <hi>He that ſhall blaſpheme againſt the Holy Ghoſt, hath never forgiveneſs, but is in danger of eternal damnation.</hi> Which words Chriſt ſpake unto them, <hi>Becauſe they ſaid, he hath an unclean ſpirit;</hi> Mark 3. 28-30. And in this their blaſphemy
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:185024:105"/>
they acted, or ſpake worſe than the <hi>Egyptian Magicians,</hi> Exod. 8. 19. And hereby alſo <hi>they ſcattered abroad</hi> others from Chriſt, who were gathering to him by theſe mighty works wrought by the Holy Spirit. See <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 30, 31. and <hi>Luke</hi> 11. 23. And ſo this may be called <hi>the Blaſphemy againſt the Holy Ghoſt,</hi> as <hi>the Holy Ghoſt</hi> ſignifies, as oft it doth, the miraculous works, or extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit; <hi>Joh.</hi> 7. 39. <hi>Act.</hi> 10. 44, 46. and Ch. 19. 1. 6, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider we this hainous ſin, as to the continuance of it: This Blaſphemy, which our Saviour declares to be unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable, is not one word, or act, on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, againſt the Holy Spirit, but a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting therein, until this ſin be finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And therefore in St. <hi>Matthew,</hi> and <hi>Luke,</hi> this ſin is expreſt in the <hi>Preſent-tenſe, [whoſoever ſpeaketh,</hi> Matth. 12. 32. or <hi>Blaſphemeth,</hi> Luk. 12. 10.] And words of the Preſent time uſually denote the duration or continuance of any act; as, <hi>B<gap reason="illegible" resp="#APEX" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lieveth, cometh, eateth, abideth, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth,</hi> &amp;c. Joh. 3. 15, 16, 18. and ch. 6. 35. 37, 54-58. and ch. 8. 12. 1 Joh. 3. 6. And this may further appear more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, in that this Blaſphemy is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſt
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:185024:106"/>
in <hi>Mark</hi> 3. 29. in the Future time, <hi>He that ſhall blaſpheme,</hi> &amp;c. to wit, ſhall go on ſo to do, till this ſin hath brought forth Death<hi>:</hi> And this will yet further appear, if we diligently conſider that our Saviour prayed for theſe Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers alſo, when he was upon the Croſs, <hi>Luk.</hi> 23. 33, 34. And when raiſed again, was <hi>ſent to bleſs them, in turning away e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of them from his iniquities;</hi> Act. 2. 22, 23-8. and ch. 3. 13-15, 19, 26. 1 Tim. 1. 13-16. with Act. 26. 10, 11. So that what our Saviour ſpeaks of this Blaſphemy, is no diſcouragement unto any mans returning from his wicked ways, nor denial of a poſſibility ſo to do hopefully, while it is the day of God's grace and patience; though it be a powerful Antidote to preſerve and deterre men from this hainous ſin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. In the next place conſider we alſo what the Apoſtle ſaith in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4-6. <hi>For it is impoſſible for thoſe who were once enlightned,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>If they ſhall fall away, to renew them again to repentance,</hi> &amp;c. Like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whereto is that other Scripture in the ſame Epiſtle; namely, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26, 27, 28, 29.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:185024:106"/>
Now for our better underſtanding hereof, mind we theſe things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>From whence,</hi> or after what, <hi>they fell away;</hi> and that is, as it is expreſt in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 26. <hi>after the knowledge, or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, of the truth received:</hi> And after <hi>they were ſanctified</hi> thereby, ver. 29. And as it appears in this <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. 4, 5. they fell from an high degree of Chriſtianity, and after they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived true and excellent operations of the Spirit, anſwering unto, as hath been obſerved by ſome, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>named Principles in ver. 1. 2. As to ſay,</p>
            <p>1. <hi>They were once enlightned,</hi> as ch. 10. 32. that is, by the Holy Spirit their eyes were opened, and they were convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced of the vileneſs of their Sins, and vanity of their Idols; and ſo had effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted in them <hi>Repentance from dead works,</hi> as ver. 1. with <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 26. 18-20-23.</p>
            <p>2. <hi>They had taſted of the heavenly gift:</hi> That is to ſay, as anſwering to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Principle in ver. 1. they were made partakers of <hi>Faith towards God,</hi> and ſo of that <hi>Faith,</hi> which is of <hi>the operation of God,</hi> Col. 2. 12. by which

            <p>3. <hi>And were made partakers of the Holy Ghoſt:</hi> This Anſwers to the Doctrine of Baptiſms, in ver. 2. and ſhews that theſe, by the ſeveral mediums of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, were, by the powerful operation of the Holy Spirit, <hi>Baptized into the death of Chriſt;</hi> as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6. 3. And were alſo <hi>riſen again with him, by the faith of the operation of God, who raiſed Chriſt from the dead,</hi> as <hi>Col.</hi> 2. 12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 3. 10. And alſo they were endued with the Excellent and Spiritual gifts of the Holy Spirit, whereby they were enabled to praiſe and ſerve God acceptably, and to be profitable unto Men and Brethren: Yea, they might be made partakers of ſome extraordinary gifts of the Holy Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 4-12-23.</p>
            <p>4. <hi>And have taſted the good Word of God:</hi> which Anſwers unto the fourth
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:185024:107"/>
Principle in ver. 2. to wit, the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of <hi>the laying on of hands:</hi> In which Doctrine is taught us, That God had graciouſly promiſed to hear the Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers preſented in the Name of Chriſt, and to give gracious returns thereto: And that, <hi>where two or three were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered together in Christ's name, he would be in the midſt of them;</hi> namely, in ſuch Aſſemblings, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18. 19, 20. <hi>Of this good Word of God,</hi> in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his gracious Promiſes, <hi>they had taſted:</hi> They had proved his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſneſs and Faithfulneſs in hearing their Prayers, and granting their Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, and in manifeſting his Preſence with them, and Bleſſing upon them, in their <hi>watching at his gates, and waiting at the poſts of his doors;</hi> as <hi>Prov</hi> 8. 34, 35<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

            <p>5, and 6. Have taſted <hi>of the Powers of the world to come:</hi> which Anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the two laſt Principles in ver. 2. to wit, <hi>the Reſurrection of the Dead, and eternal Judgment;</hi> which follows after

the Reſurrection of the Dead. And of the Powers, in the Doctrine of both, theſe had taſted alſo, namely, proved, and in ſome meaſure experimented, the mighty Power of God, exerted in the Reſurrection, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1. 19, 20. in quicken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to a lively hope; in raiſing them to ſeek after, and mind the things above, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 1, 2.

To which I ſhall no further enlarge. [See Mr. <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas Moore</hi> Senior, in his <hi>Explicite De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the Teſtimony of Chriſt,</hi> Page 585—591.]</p>
            <p>But by what hath been ſaid, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, they were eminent Believers, and fell from an high degree of Chriſtianity; higher than moſt attain unto who fill themſelves with needleſs fears, as if they were guilty of the grand Miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of theſe; and ſo in an hopeleſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Conſider we nextly, the Depth
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:185024:108"/>
of their Fall; and ſo the abominable hainouſneſs of their Tranſgreſſion; and that is ſuch as in which they were guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of high Apoſtacy, and revolt; or there was in them <hi>an evil heart of unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, in Apoſtatizing from the living God;</hi> as <hi>Heb.</hi> 3. 12, 13. And their Apoſtacy was firſt more inward and particular; and then more open and general.</p>
            <p n="1">1. More inward and particular; and ſo it is thus expreſt by the Apoſtle, <hi>they crucifie [to themſelves] the Son of God afreſh, Heb.</hi> 6. 6. That is, by an evil heart of unbelief they inwardly look upon Chriſt as an Impoſtor and Decei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, as an Accurſed one, (as, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. 3.) from whom they expect no ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and on his Goſpel as a cheat and impoſture: or as the Apoſtle in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. expreſſes it, <hi>they tread under foot the Son of God, and count the bloud of the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, wherewith they were ſanctified, a profane; polluted thing:</hi> Thus they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count it in their evil and revolting hearts, and ſo inwardly turn from him that ſpeaketh; <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 25.</p>
            <p n="2">2. More outwardly and generally to others, <hi>[they put him to an open ſhame,]</hi> namely they diſgrace and vilifie him
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:185024:109"/>
publickly, and unto others, <hi>and make him a publick example,</hi> as the ſame word is rendred in <hi>Matth.</hi> 1. 19. or they ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him to others as an infamous and accurſed perſon, as one that was ſuch a Malefactour and Deceiver, as that he juſtly ſuffered that ſhameful, painful, and accurſed Death for his own De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merit; and hereby, (as we have noted before on <hi>Matth.</hi> 12. 30, 31.) they <hi>ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> others <hi>abroad</hi> from Chriſt, who were gatheted unto him; and ſo are highly injurious to their ſouls. And this ſame expreſſion here rendred, <hi>they put</hi> him <hi>to an open ſhame,</hi> is made uſe of by the <hi>Septuagint</hi> in <hi>Numb.</hi> 25. 4. where we read, <hi>[hang them up before the Lord,</hi> &amp;c.] They read it, <hi>[make them a publick ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample,</hi> or <hi>put them to an open ſhame,</hi> &amp;c.] And ſo anſwerably in <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 29. it is ſaid, <hi>they offer deſpite unto,</hi> or rail upon, <hi>the Spirit of Grace;</hi> even the Goſpel of Chriſt, (as anſwering unto <hi>Moſes Law,</hi> ver. 28.) and ſo, the holy Spirit; for the <hi>Goſpel was with the holy Spirit ſent down from heaven,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. 12. And ſo they railed upon, and reviled Chriſt, who is the ſum and ſubject matter of the Goſpel, and of whom the Spirit of
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:185024:109"/>
Grace bears witneſs<hi>:</hi> And one Branch of, or ſtep unto this hainous iniquity and revolt is, <hi>the forſaking of the publick Aſſemblies</hi> of Chriſtians; <hi>Heb.</hi> 10. 25, 26-29. By the greatneſs and depth then of their Fall and Revolt, many who wrongfully charge themſelves with this tranſgreſſion, may aſſuredly know they are not guilty of it; for then others might know it as well as they.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>It is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to renew them,</hi> &amp;c. he ſpeaks not as to God, but as to themſelves, in their miniſtration of the Goſpel, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by word or writing: And ſo theſe words are the reaſon of what the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle had been fore-ſaying, in <hi>ver.</hi> 1. <hi>viz. Therefore leaving the principles of the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Chriſt, let us go on to perfection; not laying again the foundation,</hi> &amp;c.<hi>—For it is impoſſible,</hi> &amp;c. As if he ſhould ſay, It will be a needleſs buſineſs for us, to be always declaring and inſiſting upon <hi>the firſt principles of the Oracles of God,</hi> as with reſpect to theſe Apoſtates; for that way <hi>they will not be renewed again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance:</hi> and ſo not by their preaching or writing always theſe things. And therefore they would proceed on in
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:185024:110"/>
ſpeaking of, or propounding in Writing, the more high and myſterious things of the Goſpel, for the ſakes of thoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers who ſtill held faſt to the Lord. But yet, <hi>the things which were unpoſſible with men, are poſſible with God:</hi> Luk. 18. 27. And therefore, while theſe Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates were joyned to all the living, the Believers might pray for them, That God would <hi>fill their faces with ſhame, that they might ſeek his name;</hi> as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 83. 15, 16. and 69. 22, 23. with <hi>Rom.</hi> 11. 8-11, 32, 33. But to this we ſhall have apt oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to ſpeak further in the next Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, which is now in order to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us<hi>:</hi> Namely,</p>
            <p n="3">3. For as to 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that the Apoſtle there forbids that <hi>ſuch as ſin the ſin unto death, ſhould be prayed for.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. Suppoſe God ſhould have ſaid in that Scripture, to wit, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. <hi>Pray not for that perſon that ſinneth the ſin unto death;</hi> might not ſuch an one have been prayed for any more, had there been ſuch a prohibition? We may ſee that God commands <hi>Jeremiah</hi> once, and a ſecond time, thus, <hi>Pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry, nor</hi>
               <pb n="203" facs="tcp:185024:110"/>
               <hi>prayer for them, neither make interceſſion to me, for I will not hear thee;</hi> Jer. 7. 16. and Ch. 11. 14. And yet the Prophet, knowing that God was gracious and merciful, <hi>prays for them again;</hi> Ch. 14. 7, 8, 9. Then the Lord a third time ſaith to the Prophet, <hi>Pray not for this people for their good;</hi> Ch. 14. 11, 12. But not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all this, the Prophet again lifts up his heart with his hands to God in the heavens for them; <hi>Jer.</hi> 14. 19, 20-22. And ſurely God is as gracious to ſinners now, and to the chief of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, as he was then; yea, in theſe laſt days, his grace hath been more largely expreſt, and more brightly manifeſted, than in former times, <hi>in that he hath ſent his only begotten Son into the world, that we might live thorow him:</hi> 1 Joh. 4. 8, 9, 10-14. But,</p>
            <p>2. That Scripture we are now conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 5. 16. is by many much miſtaken; for the Apoſtle there doth not forbid us to pray for the perſon that ſinneth unto death. It is not there ſaid, <hi>There is a ſin unto death: I do not ſay that he ſhall pray for [him;]</hi> but, <hi>[for,</hi> or, <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it;]</hi> to wit, <hi>the ſin:</hi> On which God may take vengeance as long as the
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:185024:111"/>
perſon guilty thereof lived; yea and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his death long: and yet the ſoul of that ſinning perſon may be ſaved in the day of the Lord. God ſaid to <hi>Eli,</hi> yea <hi>he ſware unto the houſe of Eli,</hi> that <hi>his, and their iniquity ſhould not be purged with ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, nor offering for ever;</hi> 1 Sam. 3. 13, 14. And it was puniſhed long after <hi>Eli</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>s death, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 2. 27. And the ſame may be ſaid of the ſins of <hi>Manaſſes,</hi> 2 King. 24. 3, 4. and yet their ſouls were ſurely ſaved. See alſo 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. 10. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 99. 8. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 22. 12, 14. <hi>Act.</hi> 8. 22, 23. So that, though the ſin might not be prayed for, yet the perſon ſo ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, might (notwithſtanding any thing there ſaid) while he was <hi>joyned to all the living;</hi> for ſo long <hi>there is hope</hi> for men<hi>: Eccl.</hi> 9. 4. Nay,</p>

the eyes of all living. It is laid up with God, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9. 27. and therefore it is moſt dangerous to delay the time<hi>: for in the grave whither thou goeſt, there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom:</hi> Eccl. 9. 10. Thou haſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly ſeen ſome others removed out of the Land of the Living, in the prime and flower of their age, that were as like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to have lived to Old Age, as thoſe that are leſt behind<hi>:</hi> for <hi>ſome die in their full ſtrength, being wholly at eaſe and quiet; whoſe breaſts are full of milk, and their bones are moiſtened with marrow:</hi> Job 21. 22-24.
